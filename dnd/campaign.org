** History of the 5 Nations at War
	 First off, none of the "nations" at war are actually nations. They are just
	 kingdoms or areas that are fighting for some reason. However, they are called
	 nations because each of them, rule over more land than what they originally
	 ruled. For example, Vet'ric, once a trade city, only ruled a "medium sized"
	 area within it's walls and some small areas around them. Whence the spark of
	 war was struck, Vet'ric rapidly gained 3x the area it originally ruled. This
	 newly ruled area was now consider part of the Vet'ric /nation/. Most other
	 nations in the war had a similar experience.

*** East/West Argougnian
		The history of Argougnian is rather unknown. Most of the "facts" about this
		place are still argued and may not be 100% true. Anywho...

		Argougnian was originally a single city that wasn't really know for anything
		too serious. They were similar to Lum'is, a media center, but for the
		Western part of the land. People from all over the western land would go
		there to find out the news that was traveling around.

		Then one day, a fearless leader lead an army of hundreds into the
		town. However, the locals didn't give up without a fight. This battle was
		known as *The Civil War of Argougnian*. As a direct result to the war,
		Argougnian broke up into 2 unions: east and west. The war didn't last more
		than a few months leaving west Argougnian in ruins. East Argougnian had
		little to no loss in terms of inventory.

		After the war, East Argougnian didn't recover it's population. In fact, it
		didn't go back to being a media center either. It was empty. Around this
		time, the Great Vet'ric Trade Center was opening. The new rulers of East
		Argougnian had a great idea - make a trade center for the Western part, then
		people will flock to their town. They failed terribly at doing so. As a
		direct result, East Argougnian became known for 3 things: silk trade, food
		trade, and thieves. The only successful traders in the area were silk and
		food, and no one knows why. Because of West Argougnian being a place of
		poverty and ruins, crime rates sky rocketed once traders came in.

		Although not seen as a world power, East Argougnian still got involved in
		the Nation Wars. How did they get involved you ask? Well, the brutes of
		Rellekka wanted to dominate more land, so they went searching for places to
		pillage and rule. Once they go far enough south, they ran into
		Argougnian. The rulers of East Argougnian stood there ground as best as they
		could against the brutal forces of Rellekka. Luckily, around half way
		through the battle a random army of rogues, wizards, sorcerers, and priests
		helped East Argougnian. This allowed East Argougnian to back off the forces
		of Rellekka.

		The battle between Rellekka and East Argougnian is still going on. It is one
		of the most dangerous battles to get involved in due to the large amount of
		magic users and brutal fighters.

*** Falendrone
		The Royal Kingdom of Falendrone was create many many /many/ years ago. It
		was started, obviously, by the family of Falend. They conquered the land
		from Orcs, Goblins, Giants, and Trolls because they wanted the secret mine
		that was underneath the land. The mine consists of miles upon miles iron,
		gold, and many other rare metals. It is said that one of the metals found
		within these mines is a white metal, called *Whiron*. It is supposedly far
		stronger than iron and is only used by *The Knights of Falendrone*. It is
		also said that the mine contains another rare metal called *Vibranium*. This
		metal is said to be one of the strongest materials around and can deflect
		/any/ missile. It is not known whether or not it actually exists.

		Falendrone wasn't really known for much except their superior mining
		operations. It is said that they create the best weapons and armor in the
		entire world. Other than that, there are only 3 other things that are
		important to know about the place.
		1. They have /highly/ trained knights.
			 1. The knights are trained in hand-to-hand combat and are known to being
          superior to most anyone.
			 2. Their paladins are also trained professionals of hand-to-hand combat,
          once again, being superior to most.
			 3. Their rangers are known for having arrows that can pierce through iron
          and they /never/ miss.
			 4. Their priests are wise and also very dangerous to fight.
		2. They seldom let anyone into the castle walls
			 1. In fact, no one really knows what it's like inside those pristine
          white walls.
			 2. It is said to be one of the most beautiful places in the world.
		3. There is a special room inside the castle called *The Party Room*.
			 1. No body knows what happens in the party room, but it's gotta be fun!

		Needless to say, Falendrone is not a place to be an enemy of. The king(s) of
		Falendrone have a burning hatred for Vet'ric because, to them, it is not a
		kingdom. It is a fool pretending to be king and they make /actual/ kingdoms
		look back.

		Once Falendrone announced their war on Vet'ric, they sent out a very small
		amount of troops to take them down. To the troops surprise, Vet'ric had
		pagan summoners that could summon demons and devils! The troops retreated to
		tell of the news. The king ordered that we send out messengers saying that
		Falendrone would like to hire some wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, or any
		other magic users for the battle.

		While the messengers were going all over the place, they informed the
		"kingdom" of Rellekka and, what was now split, East Argougnian about he
		offer. This is how both East Argougnian and Rellekka heard about the
		war. The now recovering Argougnians declined the offer for now. Rellekka,
		however, decided to join the battle on the team of Falendrone.

		After many years of working with Rellekka, the Falendrone king got upset. He
		claimed that the Rellekka barbarians were trash at their job and are not
		worthy to be fighting on the team of Falendrone.

		NOTE: This is mostly true actually. The barbarians of Rellekka really stood
		no chance against the demons and devils of the Vet'ric. They also had most
		troops get killed, on average, than Falendrone whom rarely lost a troop.

		The Rellekkaian "king" decided to turn on Falendrone and the war between
		Rellekka and Falendrone began.

		Falendrone doesn't really need to put much effort in fight that war because
		their knights are far superior to the barbarians of Rellekka.

*** Kelczar
		Kelczar is, big surprise, very unknown. In fact, the least is known about
		this place because of how far from civilization it is.

		Things we know about Kelczar:
		1. The somehow know if you step foot on their Desert.
		2. They are cannibals.
		3. They have giant scorpions.
		4. They have pyramids and lots of hidden tombs that no one has every
       explored.
		5. They consist mostly of magic users.
			 1. Wizards, sorcerers, druids, and warlocks.
		6. They supposedly have a shit ton of gems and gold that is worth a lot.
		7. They also supposedly have a /huge/ (bigger than Falendrone's) mine that
       is somewhere in the desert. It is said that the mine has many rare metals
       such as Adamant and a black metal called Obsidium.

		That's pretty much all. You probably shouldn't go there, although, you can
		pay for safe travel to one of the cities if you go to their gate at the East
		end of Lum'is. It's expensive and probably isn't worth risking your life to
		go there.

*** Rellekka
		Dare I call this place a kingdom... Rellekka is basically the scum capital
		of the world. It consists mostly of barbarians, but has a few fighters,
		rangers, rogues and warlocks. (Imagine a viking village of ruthless
		bastards)

		Rellekka is technically ruled by a "king" who's name is unknown. It is said
		that he is not a humanoid, however. If you ever go there, you will notice
		that there really isn't a ruling going on. It is more like a free-for-all
		all the time. There are people getting killed at every hour of the day and
		no one cares. Really, the only good thing about the place is that there are
		a literal fuckton of people. They also have a wide variety of races, unlike
		the other nations. Giants, orcs, goblins, trolls, etc. all live in "harmony"
		here.

		No one cares about the backstory of this shithole. They aren't known for
		anything else except *The Cave of Misery*. But still, no one cares enough to
		even explore the cave.

		Once they turned on Falendrone, they decided that they wanted more land and
		started to expand. This is when they ran into Argougnian and the war between
		them started.

		That's all...

*** Vet'ric
		Vet'ric was one a small town that consisted of friendly miners, woodworkers,
		and pagan druids. In fact, the name of the town wasn't even Vet'ric! It was
		originally called Trabush, named after the founder of the town. One day a
		wealth man came to town and asked if they were in need of any business. The
		entire town being happy to gain some extra coin said sure. The man then,
		after years of work, built a trading center right outside of the town. The
		trading center was filled with tellers that would purchase any item off
		anyone and keep it. Once someone came that was in need of said item, they
		would sell it to that person. This is the business model of the *The Great*
		*Vet'ric Trader Center*.

		Vet'ric was the name of the wealthy man, who now, is even more wealthy. In
		fact, he began to make so much money off the trading center that he hired an
		army of knights to ransack the town of Trabush. After the ransacking was
		over, Vet'ric was built. A large city and castle was constructed. Due to his
		massive trading center, he became one of the wealthiest "kings" in the
		land. However, many people hated the king. All he cared about was
		money. This technocratic ruler was then challenged by the king of
		Falendrone. He claimed that the Vet'ric (the man) wasn't a king but a
		peasant that rose to power due to luck. He challenged him to
		war. Vet'ric being unprepared for war hired as many forces as he could to
		protect the city and fight against his new enemy.

		After years of battle, Vet'ric died of old age and his son took over
		rule. The lineage of Vet'ric's continued for years and years and years, new
		rule the city of Vet'ric became weaker and weaker. The infrastructure of the
		city began to crumble due to lack of care and maintenance.

		Current day Vet'ric is a disgusting city that has no redeemable features
		besides the still very successful trader center. The city walls are
		crumbling, most of the builds are destroyed, and the population is are
		gangs, drug cartel, and criminals.

		Vet'ric's worst enemy is Falendrone. According to Vet'ric's shitty yet loyal
		population, Falendrone attacking the city is what makes it a bad place. The
		people would do /anything/ to see Falendrone destroyed.

		NOTE: The pagan druids fight for Vet'ric. They are also known for summoning
		demons. This is one of the key reasons why Vet'ric has yet to fall to the
		truly superior Falendrone warriors.

		Once the war truly began, Vet'ric decided that they needed to conquer more
		land and gain more allies to defeat Falendrone. As a result, they send
		demons and devils summoned by the pagans to convince the nearby lands to
		join. To the surprise of many, they agreed and helped Vet'ric. They
		attempted to even go into the *desert of Kelczar*. The Kelczarian people
		didn't like the idea of joining forces with someone by fear, so they fought
		back and pushed the Vet'ric demons and devils out of the desert. There is a
		small battle that has been going on for ages at the start of the
		*Kelczarian Desert*.

		The battle going on there is very boring though, it's mostly just guards
		standing around waiting for something to happen.
** Nation of the South
	 There are some third parties in the war that aren't really apart of the 5
	 main nations, however, they do cause some issues that you should be aware
	 of. In the South-Western tip of the map, you will see a mixture of places
	 such as *The Gnome Village*, Yandille, and *The Orge Village* (these places
	 are /much/ larger than villages, yet they are called villages). These places
	 are listed as *Nations of the South* and don't fight for any one group. It
	 is said that the Gnomes and Orges fight together against anyone who is apart
	 of /any/ of the nations. Basically, they want to keep the Nations of the
	 South as third party as possible and won't even let members of /any/ of the
	 nations pass.

	 You're probably wonder: "Why don't we just lie?" My reply is: "Why don't you
	 just die?"

** Island Nations
	 The islands that are near this world are pretty much out of the
	 loop. Crandor is an island created by a *Dark Wizard*, Qufar is basically a
	 volcano island with strange indigenous creatures, and Kirja is a great place
	 for vacation if you worship Satan.

	 None of these places have any respect for anyone associated with one of the
	 nations at war. First off, there really isn't any reason to go to Crandor or
	 Qufar. Kirja is known for some exotic items and is home to *The Devils'*
	 *Circle*. If you want to meet Satan/Lucifer himself, go there!

	 The indigenous tribes of Kirja will attempt to sacrifice you to Satan if you
	 are apart of one of the nations.

	 You're probably wondering: "Why don't we lie?" My reply: "You can always
	 try."

** Unlist Towns/Cities/Villages
	 Any unlisted places are considered "safe zones" from the nations. Anyone of
	 any nation can go into these places because they are neutral (different from
	 third party). For example, Lum'is, Catherby, Port Santus, Edgeville,
	 Yandille, Goblin Town, No man's land, etc.

	 There are some places that are not safe but are still safe in terms of
	 the nations at war. For example, *The Black Knights' Fortress*, *Trolls
	 Mountain*, *The Monastery*, and *Sand Peoples' Village*.

** Who's fighting who again?
	 Argougnian <-> Rellekka
	 Rellekka   <-> Falendrone
	 Falendrone <-> Vet'ric
	 Vet'ric    <-> Kelczar
	 Gnomes/Orges -> All
	 Kirja Tribes -> All

* Story
	This section will contain information on the stories that can be done in the
	campaign. Obviously the main story is the most important but there will be
	plenty of other fun stories to explore.

** Main Story
	 The main story takes place on a continent called Guthex. Guthex has been
	 around for thousands and thousands of years have many problems
	 throughout. The many groups of people found on the continent have been known
	 to not play well together and there have been many wars fought on its soil.

	 Your adventurers have joined the population in Guthex at a rather interesting
	 time -- during the War of Nations. The War of Nations has been poisoning the
	 soil of Guthex for over a thousand years. 5 major nations constantly at war
	 has turned Guthex into a place of villainy and debauchery. Is anywhere safe
	 in this sickening continent? You will find out.

	 The explorers believe that they have been taken to a place fairly close to
	 their previous adventure. This is completely incorrect. They have actually
	 been transported here by a spell cast on the by *The Wicked*. The Wicked has
	 sent them here for a reason that they will not figure out until deep into the
	 campaign. Let us begin.


	 The Wicked was an ancient god that was destroyed by the devil. The story is
	 that The Wicked was cursed by the devil and was forced into hiding for all of
	 eternity. After billions of years, the cursed fool returned to defeat the
	 devil for he had learned that his curse gave him infinite power. He came to
	 destroy the devil but was matched by the devil's power. After a long battle,
	 cursed fool was "destroyed."

	 The cursed fool was reborn in the form of a tree. He had powers that caused
	 pain and suffering to spread all over the land. He caused people to go insane
	 with false power. This is why he has the name The Wicked, he only causes pain
	 and suffering. His hated towards the devil has made him swear he would defeat
	 him one day. Since he is powerless again the devil due to his reborn state,
	 he must summon the warriors to defeat his enemies.

	 Your adventurers were lucky enough to catch the eye of The Wicked. So, he
	 summon them to the land of Guthex, where they will train to become strong
	 enough to kill the devil. Why Guthex? Well, Guthex is right next to an island
	 that contains a portal to hell. That is how they will destroy him.

	 The Wicked has placed another cursed fool in the future of these
	 warriors. Wart. He will help them defeat the devil.


	 This is the main goal of the entire campaign. However, this isn't revealed
	 until they defeat the 5 nations. The main quest is described next

** Kill the Nations
	 In order to start this quest, they need to talk to many different
	 people. These people will tell them how terrible the nations are and that
	 they must be destroyed. They must complete a handful of other quests to find
	 some of these people.
	 - [ ] What's in the Box?
	 - [ ] Port Santus Mystery (Witch Hunt)
	 - [ ] Slaves of Dracon
	 - [ ] Lost City of Morytania
	 - [ ] Edgeville?
	 - [ ] West Argougnian Secret
	 - [ ] Wise Words
	 - [ ] Milk from a Cactus
	 - [ ] Beaten with Ice
	 - [ ] Into the Volcano!
	 - [ ] Strangers Like Me by Phil Collins
	 - [ ] Dark Wizard


	 Once all of them are completed (Dark Wizard last), they will begin their
	 second to last quest: Kill the Nations

	 In this quest they will need to do some serious shit. Which I'll write
	 later.

** What's in the Box
	 Upon enter the city of Lum'is, the gang will be taken to the king. The king
	 will bring out his historian and he will teach them about the lands. After
	 teaching them about the shit, they will probably ask about a quest. To which
	 the following will happen:

	 King: "Hmmm, a quest? Yes... Yes... A quest..." **while stroking beard**
	 "Squire, come hither."
	 Squire: "Yes, your majesty?"
	 **whisper whisper* (asking for a quest)
	 **whisper whisper* (reminds him of the box)
	 King: "Ah yes, I've got a quest for you!"
	 "Guards, retrieve *the box*"
	 **guards leave**
	 **king shoots the shit with them**
	 **guards come back in**
	 King: "Ahh yes, the box."
	 "Take a fancy at that! What is it? Well, it's a box. The quest... open it."

   STOPPED HERE

	 The box is some kind of grey metal, very hard metal. None of them can figure
	 out what it's made out of (no it isn't vibranium). There is no lock. Nothing
	 but little holes (pin sized) all over. If they speak to the box, nothing
	 happens. If they try and open the box, nothing happens. The only way they can
	 open the box right now is if somebody who has a strength of 20+ rolls a nat
	 20 on a strength check to open it.

	 If they ask any about the box:
	 King: "All I know is that I can't find /anyone/ who can open it."
	 "Maybe ask around town? There are always new people coming and going in my
	 city!"


	 They can ask all they want but they won't find anything interesting unless
	 they talk to the Saville, the craftsman, or the priest. If they talk to the
   Saville, they will get an extra quest, however, they won't need to spend
	 an entire week waiting for the man to shown up to church.

*** Town Yeller
		The Town Yeller will be outside of the Lum'is Castle spewing off information
		about the newest most important news. When they meet him he is yelling:
		"Come one, come all, see the pin board! It has all the info ya need! Quests,
		news, politics, etc! All in once place!"

		Whence they go up to him:
		"A box that doesn't open ye say? .... Hmmm, yes.... Sounds like... Yes. Aha!
		I think I know a guy! Well, maybe... He might know a guy who knows a guy
		that knows /something/ about that..."

		Once they get excited and ask whom this is he will say:
		"Hahaha, well, here's the thing... You're in the /media/ center of the
		continent. That information isn't going to be cheap! I've gotta make my
		money gentlemen. Do you really think standing on a stump screaming all day
		makes me any money? Anyways, give me ehhh 10g and I'll tell you."

		If they deny, which they should:
		"Well, I've got another idea. Ya see, I have a message for someone. And I
		need it to be transferred to them. I'd do it myself /but/ that means I lose
		commission for standing on this stump. But I really need this message send."

		"It needs to go to a farm located right outside the walls of Vet'ric. Don't
		worry it's safe because that's still technically part of the Lum'is forest!
		All ye gotta do is travel about 3 days down that (pointing north)
		road. That's called the media trail, a safe trail for reporters and
		messengers to travel."

		Once they accept:
		**he pulls out a message**
		"Here is the message, *DO NOT OPEN IT*. The recipient will /refuse/ the
		message if it has been open!"
		**hands them the message**
		Upon inspection you notice that the message is rolled up perfect. It's on
		parchment paper that has been dyed white and has a very odd red ribbon that
		is perfectly made around it.

		"Oh yeah, the message is *not* for the farmer! It's for one of his
		children. Also, don't let /anyone/ know about the message, for it might get
		stolen or maimed! The child will give you another message in return. I need
		that reply. If I don't get it, you don't get your information."

		He doesn't know which child though.

		--------------------------------------

		Literally nothing will happen on the trip up to Vet'ric, each day of travel
		I will roll a d4, if 4, they get hassled by a group of reporters looking for
		information about a lady by the name of *Vicenessa*. Whatever that means.

		--------------------------------------

		Once they see the walls of Vet'ric, they will notice a path that goes to the
		right (east). It seems to curve back south and has a sign on the front that
		says: "Lum'is Horse Farm"

		Once the farm is in sight, they will notice that it's a cute little farm
		that has a nice selection of horses in the field. Note that this is still in
		the middle of the forest so the farm is in a wide opening in the trees and
		has a fenced in area where the horses are. You can see a man training the
		horses to jump and run and stuff. There is a large red barn that is right
		next to the fenced in area. There is also a small cottage found abut 50
		yards from the fenced in area. It's quite cute!

		The farmer will noticed them and calm the horse he was working with down. He
		will grab a pitchfork and come over to you guys.

		"What the hell are you doing on my property?"

		If they mention the letter:
		- "What letter!? To one of my kids?! Hell no! Get the hell out of here!"

		  They are now dealing with an angry parent, one of the most fierce
      creatures known to man! They can calm him down if they pass a persuasion
      skill of DC 17.  If not:
  		- Roll a perception DC of 13, if they pass they notice that there is some
        rustling in the forest. If failed, the notice nothing.
  		If yes:
   		- "Listen gentlemen, I don't want any trouble and I really would prefer if
        ye stay away from my kids. However, I will deliver the message."
			- They will not receive a reply message and fail the quest.


		If they don't mention the letter:
		"Well lemme show ye my farm!"

		He will show them his horses and explain:
		"I've got the /best/ horses on the continent! These are the fastest and most
		well trained sons of bitches out there. A lot of messengers love my horses
		because of their speed. However, I don't do business with any of those
		fucking nations, they're all scum!"

		If they ask for a horse:
		- "Sorry gents, all of the horse I have here are temporary. They are here
      because their owners have either gone in to Vet'ric or they wanted them to
      be trained a little more. I can't sell ye any right now. However, I've got
      a new batch of horses that will be ready in a couple months! Just remember
      they sell quick!"

		"So you gentlemen said you were in search of a quest? Well, if ye got the
		time, I've got a quick task if ye wanna make a quick buck!"

		If they accept: Continue to [[The Hole][The Hole]].

		If no: He tells them that he needs to get back to work training these
		horses!

		--------------------------------------

		The trip back is the same as the trip there.

		--------------------------------------

		Yeller:
		"Ah yes, you have returned! Have you transferred my message?"

		If no reply message:
		- "Well then, you bastards are more than useless! You can't even correctly
      send a message to someone!! How dare you call yourselves adventurers!!"
		- He will now /refuse/ to tell them /anything/.


		If reply message:
		- "Ahh yes, my reply!! I've been waiting for this!"
		- **He turns around, opens it, and reads it**
		- If it isn't fake, he puts it away and says: "Great! Fantastic works men!
      Now, for your info! The man you need to talk to is a man named
      *Charcoln*. He is a member of the Lum'is Church over there. He goes to
      church pretty much every Sunday! God bless him! Speaking of that.. I think
      it's Sunday now! You might be able to catch him if you get over there
      now!"

			:end of quest: (jump to [[The Priest]])

**** The Hole
		 Farmer:
		 "Well, there's this big hole that is location right over there (pointing
		 down the "driveway" and to the left a little). I need someone to fill in
		 the hole, I've got the dirt over there but I don't have the time or muscle
		 to do so! Plus my damn kids keep going in there are get covered in mud! I
		 tell them to not go in there but they never listen! Could ye do that for
		 me? I'll pay ye each 10g for the hassle!"

		 If they don't accept, they won't get on the bad side of the farmer.
		 If they do accept, and don't fill in the hole, they will be on the bad side
		 of the farmer until farther notice.

		 --------------------------------------

		 Once they get to the hole, they will notice that it isn't a hole at
		 all... It's a fucking cave! It looks wet and dark in there.

		 The inside of the cave is just like you expected: moist, dark, damp, kind
		 of smells like worms. After walking down there for d6 times, they will
		 notice a strange stone wall. There is a small slit in the wall. Unless they
		 have dark vision, they won't see anything inside.

		 Inside is a stone floor with a big circle on the ground. It has a star on
		 the inside of it and each end of the star touches the circle. Sitting
		 inside of the circle is a child. Once you notice the child she gets up and
		 runs over to the slit and whispers:
		 "Who are you people! You have to get out of here now!"

		 Whatever they say won't matter, however, if they mention the message from
		 the town yeller in Lum'is she will stop and say:
		 "Oh my... You are... Gimme the message now, quickly!"

		 If anyone looks in the slit, they will see here run into an area you can't
		 see and will come out with another message.
		 "Here is my reply! *DO NOT OPEN IT* He won't accept it if it was opened!
		 Now, get out of here! No one is supposed to be in here!!"

		 --------------------------------------

		 Fill the hole?
		 Yes - good side of the farmer, but you trap a little girl in there.
		 No - they blew the farmer off, thus, he doesn't like them.

*** The Priest
		Before [[Town Yeller]]:
		- The church is empty. All you see are the beautiful stained glass windows
      and empty pues. At the very end of the open room, you see an alter and a
      man knelt down in front of it.
		- Once you step fully into the room, he will get up and turn around.
		- "Good afternoon! My name is Priest Wheatersbe. What brings ye to Lum'is?"
		- After they tell him about the box:
		- "Hmmm, I see. I believe there is a man whom comes to church every Sunday
      by the name of *Charcoln* that might know something about that. He lives
      out in the Lum'is Swamps oddly enough.
		- Now they wait many days before Sunday... Once Sunday, continue on with the
      rest of this documentation.


		The church is filled with people! The priest is giving a sermon
		about... yeah, you guys couldn't care less so you don't actually listen.

		After the service is over, they can talk with the priest to find the guy.

		"Blessèd morning to yas! Did you enjoy the service?"

		If they say no, they better have a good reason. If yes, he'll automatically
		go with it.

		Once they tell him to find the guy, he will search.

		"There he is!"
		**He points to a very large man with struggled shoulders. His hair is long
		and dirty, beard just as long and just as dirty. You can almost smell the
		guy all the way from over here! He's wearing tattered clothing and basically
		looks homeless.**

		Charcoln:
		**in a menacingly deep voice**
		"Good morning sirs. Isn't it a great day to be alive and worship the
		almighty power of our Creator?"

		Once again, I hope they say yes. If no, they better have a good reason.

		After explaining the question:
		"Hmm, yes. I think I know exactly what you need. Follow me."

		He will take them deep into the swamps of Lum'is. And when I say deep, I
		mean it. I'm talking like about 4 *hours* later, you reach a very small
		hut that sits on top of a small bank. There isn't even a road to the
		hut. Just swampland. He says to wait outside.

		He will come out with a book and read from it:
		"Force Open/Close: 2 mind runes, 2 air runes, a key that has been grind to
		dust, and the words 'Minthou doub, Airhhu doub, dusk-to-ridle open/close'"

		"That is how you can open the box."

		"Now that I've told you how to complete your quest, you can help me finish
		mine. You see, I've got some problems living out here in the swamp... There
		is a cave about 2 hours thataway (pointing west) that contains a magical
		ore called runes. I have been collecting them for many years but there seems
		to be some kind of other force keeping me from entering the cave. If you can
		remove this force, I will create 4 runes for free: 2 mind and 2 air."

		If you decline, you can buy the runes off of him for the cheap price of 10g
		per air rune and 23g per mind rune. Declining will also put you on the bad
		side of Charcoln. Continue to [[Rune Cave]] if need be.

		--------------------------------------

		One you get back to the hut he says:
		"Rune crafting is a very very difficult art form, and it takes many hours or
		even days just to make one! Luckily, air and mind runes aren't very
		difficult. I should have these completed in about 5-6 hours. Feel free to
		adventure around the swamp just be careful, it's dangerous out here!"

		If they adventure around, they won't find anything of interest unless
		someone rolls a perception of nat 20. This means they find a cave. The cave
		is very very deep and goes off into many directions. Maybe you should take a
		note of that and come back later. :)

		If they do it long enough, they will find a small village. However, it won't
		really have much use right now.

		--------------------------------------

		Once they return to Charcoln's hut, he will have the runes finished.

		"He ye are boys, 2 air and 2 mind runes! They should work like a charm! If
		ye ever need any help with runes or with anything here in the swamp, you
		know where I live! I hope to see yas later!"

		--------------------------------------

		The trip back will have no events

		--------------------------------------

		Once in town they will need to find a key and a way to make it into
		dust. The general store will have a brass skeleton key sold for 1cp and they
		can get it smashed at the blacksmith for 5sp.

		Once they get the stuff, they can go into the castle and use the spell.

		--------------------------------------

		King:
		"Aye! My adventurers are back! Have you found any information on how to open
		the box? And who is this?!"

		"Well, nice to meet you! Where exactly are you from, Ryk'k?"

		"Hmm, what exactly /are/ you?"

		"Well, never mind that anyways! Have you found a way to open the box?!"

		The instant the last word in the spell is said the runes mystically become a
		smoke like material and are swirled around the box. The little brass pieces
		of key are also mixed in this smokey-like appearance. You can see that the
		smoke and pieces of brass around going in and out of the little holes in the
		box and then... A slit forms around the top of the box (imagine like a
		present box). Then the magical smoke and brass disappears.

		"Well? What the hell happened!?"

		Anyone can open the box now.

		Upon opening the box there will be a little small creature inside. It's face
		is covered by a hood. The robe it wears is brown and old looking. It looks
		clean and well taken care of.

		"Fantastic works! These guys are great! Really!! Wonderful! What the hell is
		in the box?"

		If anyone touches the creature, not on the skin (you can't see the skin), it
		will spring to life.

		Wart:
		"HUhahahah!"
		**he jumps out and his hood falls off revealing the face that is Wart**

		Everyone roll a intimidation save, DC 15.

		"Dear God! What the hell is that!! Kill it guards!!!"

		Wart: "Hey hey, easy easy!!! I come in peace! My name is Wart, I have been
		reborn on this planet once again by our ruler, godking Lucifer. I do not
		wish anyone harm, if you would please let me know, I must leave!"

		King: "Guards hold on! .... So what you're telling me is that you are the
		spawn of Satan himself?"

		Wart: "Not exactly. I have been reborn by godking Lucifer for some reason. I
		must be on my way. I promise you or your people no harm!"

		King: "He kind of looks like a frog but uglier... Do you really think that
		I'm going to let my new prized possession go?"

		Wart: "Prized possession??? I am no one's possession except the godking
		Lucifer. If you wish to play this game - King - so be it. I will give you
		one chance to let me leave."

		King: "Guards, take this fiend and place him in the dungeon! He should
		have been left in that box!"

		Once the guards get close to Wart he waves his hands and the two guards
		going near him get covered in a strange black material. They start to scream
		in pain and fall to their knees begging to be saved by their king.

		King: "Dear God... Stop this madness you fiend! If you attack my men, you
		are starting a war with Lum'is!"

		Wart: "If I can kill two of your men this easily, what do think I can do to
		100 men? I will purge these men of their plague if you let me go, if not, I
		will cause your entire kingdom pain and suffer."

		The king scared for this life begs Wart: "Please do not! You may run free!"

		At that instance, Wart waved his hands and very painful-looking red sores
		grew on the guards. They slumped over as if dead.

		Wart: "They will be fine, the healing sores are quite painful but they have
		been cured of their plague. You should get them to hospice as quickly as
		possible to ensure their survival."

		King: "Someone please! Take these men to hospice! <under his voice> If we
		have one???"

		Wart then begins to leave the room.

		King: "Wart!"

		**wart turns around**

		King: "I have a feeling we shall met again."

		Wart: "If it is so..."

		*exit Wart

		--------------------------------------

		King: "I'm sorry my friends.... I need to rest... Please feel free to do the
		same after what we just witnessed..."

		**the king passes out**

		--------------------------------------

		They can do whatever they please now, stay, leave, go find Wart,
		etc. However, the next quest, is given to them by the king.

		--------------------------------------

		Once they see the king again:

		King: "Aye, I am sorry for what happened the last time we met. I wasn't
		expecting something like that to happen. Anyways, I suppose you are looking
		for payment for your quest?"

		"Yes very good, here, take 100G for your troubles... Also, you are welcome
		to stay in the Lum'is castle as long as you wish, just let me know. Now, I
		have another task for you brave warriors, if you dare..."

		Jump to [[Port Santus Mystery]]

		:end of quest:

**** Rune Cave
		 Charcoln will take you over to the cave. It looks like a normal-ass cave as
		 far as you can tell. Since it's a swamp the cave is very very damp, pitch
		 black, and the floor to the cave is practically mud.

		 "Good luck in there boys. Just keep going until you find the rune deposit,
		 that is were the force is coming from."

		 Throughout the trip of d6 turns, they will hear a lot of scary noises and
		 other weird shit.

		 Once they get close enough, they will notice a very bright light coming
		 from the end of the corridor.

		 The rune deposit is absolutely amazing looking. The "room" is huge and the
		 walls are white and very bright. You see a bunch of areas that have been
		 mined (assumed by Charcoln), in fact, there is a pickaxe that you can see
		 in one of the holes. You notice that there are a bunch of gray blotches all
		 over the place in here, I wonder what those are... After about 1 minute of
		 looking around, they hear a noise. A voice....

		 "Get out of my rune deposit, fools, or face the consequences!"

		 If they leave, they safe. If not, roll an initiative.

		 There are 3 specters.

		 If they defeat them very easily, they will hear the voice again: "I
		 see. You fools wish to die on my property? I hope you all enjoy an endless
		 life of suffering. Prepare for the /wraith/!!"

		 A wraith is spawned.

		 After defeating it, the voice will say: "Strong group I see. You have won
		 this time. I'll be hunting for you"

		 After they succeed, it feels like a heavy weight has been taken off of the
		 place. A few minutes after, Charcoln will enter the room.

		 "Ahh yes thank you boys!! I can finally start my collection of runes again!
		 Here, lemme show ye how to mine for runes quickly!"

		 **he picks up his axe and goes over to one of the greyish colored blotches
		 on in the pure white wall/floor.

		 "Don't swing too hard or it'll break the rune, then you'll go flying
		 thataway! (pointing behind himself)"

		 **He carefully taps the pickaxe around the edge of the grey area. Pieces of
		 white rock are being chipped away slowly but surely.**

		 After doing that for quick from time he says:
		 "Once you're towards the end like this, give it one big swing to knock it
		 off, but don't hit the actual rune!"

		 **an ugly piece of gray stone is broken off the white wall**

		 "This, is an uncrafted rune! I take this back to me workshop and craft it
		 into many runes that can be used for magic. Now, let us go back."

     --------------------------------------

     When they exit the mine, have everyone roll an investigation and if anyone
     gets above 15, they will notice a man hiding behind a tree about 60ft
     away.

     Once they notice him he will hide behind the tree.

     It's Kysu: Just improvise.

		 :end of quest:
** Port Santus Mystery
	 King Lum'is: "Aye, good men. Good men you are. So, there are been a problem
	 occurring over at the port for a couple years now. There is rumor of a witch
	 that is terrorizing the people of the port. I would like ye to kill the
	 witch."

	 If they ask questions, he will respond:
	 "Listen, I just rule the place, I don't know the logistics! Go to Port Santus
	 and talk with Tally'an and Topiz about it. They know better than I. All I ask
	 is that you bring me the head of the witch, to verify that you've completed
	 the task."

	 Once accepted: "Fair well and good luck my adventurers! I know you will not
	 fail me!"

	 --------------------------------------

	 The trip to the port will have nothing. It takes 3 days.

	 --------------------------------------

   Once there, go to Tally'an and Topiz's house and talk with them about it.

   Topiz: "Hahaha! I can't believe the king is sending another group to try and
   kill that damn witch.

   Tally'an: "It's truly amazing that he keep s sending people to do it..."

   "Anyways! Here's the deal: There is a witch that lives about a day and a half
   that-a-way (pointing North-west). Every year for the past a billion years, it
   comes down and steals some children and eats them or whatever witches do. The
   king has been sending people to kill it for like 10 years now, no one can
   ever do it. So good luck, I guess."

   Topiz: "Hahah! Yeah, good knowing you guys! I hope you enjoyed you stay in
   Lum'is."

   If they ask why the Dracon Clan hasn't taken care of it:

   Topiz: "Well, you see, it's out of the Dracon's area. They're suppose to
   protect /most/ of Lum'is minus the actual city and this port. They also don't
   do anything in the swamp or the north-west part that is near Falendrone. So
   technically they don't have to do anything there."

   Tally'an: "If you guys succeed, with you probably won't, I want to see the
   ed of that bitch!"

   Once the conversation ends, they can go on the quest!

   --------------------------------------

   During the first day, they will be walking along minding their own business
   when all of a sudden 2 frog people (Bullywug) will run out into the path
   screaming "Help us! Help us! Our village is under attack!!"

   You can avoid the bad conflict by first finding out that it's a trap. To do
   so, someone much have a hunch that it's a trap and roll a perception
   check. They aren't very charismatic so the DC is only (d20 - 2) 13 max.

   If they battle these fuckers, they will most likely win. However, every
   restart of the initiative I will roll a d20. If >18, the rest of the gang (3
   others) hears the fight and will join. Including the 3 Ettercaps they were
   with.

   They won't find anything worth a shit if they go looking to see where they
   came from. This was simply a ploy to get some food, except they picked the
   wrong group.

   --------------------------------------

   Day 2 won't have anything for the first half of the day.


   You come up to a small old shack. It has moss growing all over it and looks
   like it's about to fall over at any moment. While gazing at the shitty place,
   the door opens and little girl will run out. She will say: "Hi!!!" waving her
   hand. "Wanna come in and play?" They can not fall for the voice with a
   insight check DC 14 and not fall for the appearance with a DC 20
   investigation. They will fall for it otherwise.

   If they don't fall for it BATTLE TIME! She will transform into her real form
   (Green Hag) and yell "Sister! It looks like we have some *MEN* for tonight!"
   Her sister will come out of the house, who is a Night Hag.

   Whomever is the last hag left, and once she gets around 25% HP, she will pull
   out a wand and zap the house. It will erupt like a volcano and lava will spew
   out, melting the entire place. The lava will not hit anyone. She will then
   say: "You will *NEVER* see what we've been working on! *NEVER*! Try and get
   to our cellar now!"

   If they DO fall for it:
   For every speech line she says, they can make the insight check and
   investigation.
   Girl: "C'mon in! Grammy is making some soup, if ya want some!"
   Grammy: "Sweetie, what do we have here?"
   Girl: "Some friends that wanted to come in a play with us!"
   Grammy: "Oh, we just /love/ *playing* don't we?"
   Girl: "Yes we sure do!"
   Grammy: "Let's eat some lunch before we play, okay? Are you boys alright with
   that?"

   If they eat the soup, they will go unconscious.

   To be continued...

   *If this actually happens, things will have to be improvised.*

   --------------------------------------

   Well, the battle is over. What to do now? The house is a big pile of lava and
   what did she mean by "what we've been working on?" If they wish to see what
   was in their cellar, jump to [[*The Hags' Cellar][The Hags' Cellar]], otherwise, they can return to
   the Tally'an and Topiz with the head of the hag and then to the king with the
   head.

   --------------------------------------

   Topiz: "NO. FUCKING. WAY. You guys did it?!"

   Tally'an: "I think I just shit my pants! We've never seen warriors like you
   before! Congratulations and thank you!"

   Topiz: "I think I've got just the thing for you!"

   **runs upstairs**

   You hear a chest being opened and then closed.

   "Take this."

   He hands out a small silk bag.

   "Inside is something called *Solidaria*. It's a powder substance. Don't ask
   what it is or what it does, just don't get caught with it. You might need it
   in case you get into trouble."

   After the conversation, they leave for the Lum'is Castle or spend the night
   in the inn.

   Nothing of importance will happen on the trip there.

   --------------------------------------

   King: "Greetings! My adventures! How are thee!? Wait... Wait a minute. You're
   still alive? HOW? That means you guys.... killed the witch?"

   "No way. I can't believe this. Squire! Go into my room and get these
   gentlemen their pay and a Lum'is wafer!"

   You each get a bag of coin (25G each) and a wafer.

   "The bags contain 25G each. The wafer is a special treat... Go head. Eat
   them."

   The Lum'is Wafer will increase one of their ability scores by 1. No
   limit. They also gain a 1d10 inspiration die that will stay until used. It
   can be used for anything from a saving throw to a AC check to a damage roll
   to a skill check.

   "What do you think of /that/? Haha, no they aren't for sale. I decided to get
   them crafted just for you guys, if you were to return! HAHA! I can't believe
   it. Go on, rest now. I'm having a celebration tonight because of your
   successes!"

   They can now go and rest. Around 8PM that evening there is an event where all
   the towns folk and the king and everyone get fucking smashed and party. If
   they attend the party, and not fuck things up, it will increase their
   popularity even more.

   :end

*** Underground River of Lum'is
    Bushma: "What are ye boys doin here in Lum'is?"

    If they answer by saying something about a quest by the king:
    "Ahh yes I see... My brother, *Pu'in*, was sent on a quest by the king. He
    never returned..."

    "He was sent by the king to take care of some witch that was found in the
    forest of Lum'is... Supposedly, she was located about a day's travel from
    the Port. Rumor is that Pu'in died at the hands of the witch."

    If they don't mention the king or quest, she will eventually bring it up.


    She does not explicitly say that she wants them to go and find her brother
    but if she gives them this talk, they've started this quest.

    --------------------------------------

    Once they've defeated the hags, they can either bring Pu'in back to town or
    leave him and the other prisoners to die. If they bring him back, they can
    complete this side quest.

    --------------------------------------

    If they enter the bar with Pu'in:

    Bushma: "Is that!? .... PU'IN!!!!" **crying**

    She runs up and hugs her lost brother with tears running down her face.

    "How can I ever repay you boys?!"

    She won't give them whatever, but if they say free booze, she'll say
    sure. She won't give them money or anything ridiculous.

    After all the joy is done, she will ask them to follow her to the back. In
    the cellar of the building they will go. The cellar is cold and dark. You
    can heard the hustle and bustle from the people upstairs in the bar very
    quaintly. The candle she brought only illuminating a small bit of the
    cellar, but enough to see wear you are going. She takes you to a locked iron
    door.

    "There is a secret behind this door. Do *NOT* tell *ANYONE* about it!"

    **whisper whisper** (saying some words under her breath)

    The lock on the door, unlocks with a click! She carefully swings the door
    open and inside of this small closet-like room is some kind of iron trapdoor
    with another lock and handle on it. She whispers again and that lock
    unlocks, with another click.

    "Down this trapdoor is a cave. The cave is called the *Underground River of
    Lum'is*. It will take you to far off places completely unseen. However, it
    is still quite dangerous to use. If you do not know how to navigate down
    there, you will surely get lost. Not to mention, the Kuo-Toas that live
    down there can be quite the scare! There are also other creatures down there
    that can make travel quite difficult, if you don't know what you're doing! I
    imagine this could be a use to you adventurers, so here it is! Use it
    wisely."

    If they ask about a map of the place:
    "People whom use the river do *not* make maps or tell others about
    it. You either have to figure it out yourself or become friends with the
    Kuo-Toas and they will guide you."

    After the talk is over, she will bring them back up to the bar for a drink,
    where they can discuss their next adventure.

    This quest will make the group look really amazing to all in the bar and
    will increase their overall approval rating in Lum'is and in the continent
    in general.

*** The Hags' Cellar
    They must find a way to get into the cellar. The lava is still hot, so they
    need to cool it somehow. For example, Charcoln has a spell to cool (costs $$
    for the runes), they could buy explosives from criminals, etc. They can
    figure that part out. Just improvise. They can sell their Solidaria and have
    professionals blow the hole up.

    --------------------------------------

    Under the rock they will find an metal trapdoor. It seems to have been
    unaffected by the lava. There is no lock on the door. Upon inspection they
    will find out that it is a very expensive door because it is coated in
    platinum, but is made out of iron. The platinum was enchanted to not be
    affected by heat, therefore, the door didn't melt or get damaged.

    Upon opening the door, the smell of death and despair rushes out. The ladder
    leading down is cover in a sticky material that grosses you out a little. It
    is pitch black down there and very cold. Chills roll down your spine because
    of it. It is absolutely quiet. Too quiet.... There is nothing behind the
    ladder. The hallway goes forward.


    As they walk down the hallway, they feel as though they are getting sucked
    deeper into the cave. They have a lust to continue going forward, although
    being scared and nervous.


    Eventually, they will run into a fork in the hallway. Looking down the left
    side, they will see a small light at a distance. It looks like a flame of a
    candle on the side of the wall (as far as you can tell). Down the right
    side, they see nothing of interest. Just looks like another hallway.

    --------------------------------------

    If they go down the left side, they will come up to the candle. The flame
    burns brightly. It gives you a sense of warmth and homeyness. Right next to
    the candle is an iron door with a lock on it. There is a small opening in
    the door that has bars in it. Looking inside they will see a large room. In
    the center is some kind of table. You can't really make out what it is, but
    you can see some kind of items around the table. You have a sense of anxiety
    rush into you. If they talk while near the door, a voice will come from the
    room.

    Voice: "Who's there!? Help us!"

    Whatever they say, the voice will reply:

    "I shouldn't have said anything... Beware of the **squeak of a door
    opening** ...." At that moment you hear the voice scream. You hear noises
    that sound like the person is being eaten alive.

    --------------------------------------

    If they go down the right side, the hallway will continue for a while. It's
    fairly long and doesn't have any doors. At the end of the hallway, you find
    a wooden door. It looks very old and that its been down here for many
    years. The wood is rotten and the handle is grimy.


    Opening the door with a loud squeak, the room is empty. There isn't anything
    in there. With a search >15, they will find a note that was pinned to the
    back of the door. If they search >18, they will find a small keyhole in the
    ground. There is no door that it is attached to, however. If something reads
    the note out loud, it will disintegrate and the door will slam shut. The
    note will read "Greetings, adventurers. If you are reading this, we must
    have been killed by you. You think that we wouldn't have planned for this
    day? Well, we did. Enjoy the show."  At that moment, everyone must make a
    passive wisdom save. You pass if >15. If passed, you don't fall for the
    trap. If failed, you start to see the walls of the room close in. You also
    believe that the door cannot be opened. The spell ends once the walls close
    in on the person(s). They can also be knocked out of the spell if someone
    can pass a persuasion check > (- 20 int). For example, Ryk'k has an
    intelligence of 12, thus, the persuasion check has to be greater than 8.


    After this will fiasco, the person(s) affected by the spell must take a
    short rest to regain their thoughts. If they spend too much time down there
    the beast will find them... >20 minutes. The Hell Hounds (3) will run into
    the room all at once. This means you can't funnel them into the
    room. Otherwise, if they return to the locked door it will be opened. If
    they don't ever check back, they never know that it was unlocked
    obviously. If they enter the unlocked room, they are surprised by the hounds
    (3) once they all enter. The door will slam behind them. If someone is on
    the other side of the door, they cannot join the battle unless they have
    attacks that can go through walls or through the small window.


    Once they defeat the beasts, they will see what is actually in the room. In
    the center of the room is a stretcher table. The items around the table are
    other torture tools. There is blood all over the table as well. Around the
    edge of the room are cells. There are a bunch of doors similar to the one
    for the big room. Iron and with a small window with bars. One of the doors
    is open, this is the one that the guy was killed in. Inside of that open
    isn't anything of interest - just the remains of the prisoner.


    - They can search around the room for something to unlock to doors with. They
      must specifically say that they are looking in the torture tools then roll a
      >13 to find a *skeleton key*. The key will *not* work on the cells. Also
      in the torture tools will be a bunch of bloody rope, whips, chains,
      needles, and other gross torture devices.


    - They can talk to some of the prisoners and they will all say the same
      thing for the most part. Something along the lines of "Thank you! I don't
      know where the keys to the cells are, I can't really see anything in here
      /without a light/.


    They can search and search in the room and they won't find anything of
    interest. There doesn't seem to be anything in this room that will help
    them.


    If they return to the room at the other end of the hallway, they can find
    the keyhole with a search >15, or if they've already seen it, without a
    roll. Once found, they can put the key into the hole and it will
    disintegrate. They will hear a loud click from down the hallway. At that
    moment, they will begin to hear a rumble. Hoping that they would think the
    place was about to blow, they would begin to run down the hallway to get
    out. If they don't run, the Minotaurs(3) will run into the room. The first
    one will be using it's /Charge/ attack. The others will run in and use the
    /Reckless/ attacks. They all have first initiative. The same thing will
    happen in the hallway, except they won't be able to dodge the charge attack
    very easily.


    After that battle, if they return to the jail room, all the people will be
    out of the cells. You can escort them out now. If they check each cell,
    they will find another key with a search >18. If you ask any of the
    prisoners what the key is for, they will not know. In fact, no one was in
    that cell to begin with! If they search for another key hole, they won't
    find it unless the search around the torture table. With a search >15, it
    will be found. If they key is placed into the hole, it will
    disintegrate. The hole place begins to rumble.


    The place will *not* fall until they are out. However, it will fall if they
    leave people behind. Once the party is out, the entire cellar will collapse.

** Slaves of Dracon
   Whenever the adventurers return to the king for their next quest, they will
   see this scene:

   King: "Greetings my brave warriors! Have thee come for another quest?
   (without letting them answer) Good! I've got a good one for ye. Guards,
   Squire, and the rest: Please exit the room."

   **everyone leaves**

   "Come closer, my friends."

   **comes closer**

   **whispering**
   "This next quest I have is a little more /serious/. Has another informed you
   about the Dracon Clan?"

   **answer**

   "Good good. So you know that they have worked with Lum'is for ages;
   protecting the forest and such?"

   **answer**

   "Yes. My great great great great great, I lost count... Anyways, one of the
   past kings many many moons ago made the deal with them. They have been loyal
   to us for all this time. However, I'm starting to get suspicious about
   them. They seem... /different/. I, and anyone else associated with Royal
   Lum'is, are not allowed to enter their territory. Nor is anyone associated
   with the Dracon Clan allowed to enter our royal territory. It was one of the
   rules of the deal made way back then. However, *you* all are not associated
   with anyone! So, I need you to find out what is up with the
   Dracons. Do you accept this quest?"


   If yes, "Perfect! You must Promise to keep this a complete secret. You can't
   tell anyone, for it may lead to the downfall of Lum'is! Promise?"

   If no, he will try and cox them into it.

   If yes to the promise, "Good! I must warn you, however, the Dracons do not
   Like visitors... Be careful.... Oh yeah! I almost forgot! You cannot enter
   the Dracons /manor/ unless you have 2 items: a death coin and a blood
   coin. Both of these are needed! You will be attacked otherwise. Now, the
   only problem is that we don't have any... In fact, the only place that I know
   of that has them is the Kelczarian Government. So, you'll have to go talk to
   them to get some, unless, of course, you had a way to sneak into the
   manor. Otherwise, off to Kelczar! I should also warn you that the Kelczarians
   are not the nicest people. Do whatever they tell you to do and don't start
   any fights while there, for you will surely meet your doom...... Good luck!"


   Once they are ready, "Guards, Squire, etc., come in!"


   **They come back**

   "Good luck my friends and remember what I said!"

   --------------------------------------

   At this point, they must go and figure out what exactly they wish to do. If
   they know about the Underground River, this will obviously be the best
   way. Otherwise, to Kelczar they go! Jump to [[Let the Games Begin]], if they
   choose Kelczar, [[Fish People]] if they choose Underground River, and [[Twilight:
   Evil Dead]] if they choose to go in raw.

*** Twilight: Evil Dead
    This sub-quest starts only if they do not use the Underground River or try
    to go to the manor without the coins.

    --------------------------------------

    Per usual, they make the same trip as if they were going to Port
    Santus. Instead, they stop about half way (takes about a day and a half)
    only to go north toward the manor. After about 2 hours, things start to get
    weird. The trees around you begin to change color - going from a lush green
    forest to a black scary one. The trees all around are dead and their bark is
    black. Even the ground begins to change, going from a light brown dirt to a
    gray dirt.


    At this point, everyone must roll a charisma saving throw >13 or become
    frightened and refuse to go farther.


    If they continue the journey then they will be forced to walk through a
    "haunted" forest of sorts. The blacken trees will attempt to attack them,
    thus, they will be forced to roll Dex saves >12 or be hit by the trees. Each
    tree that hits will do 1d6 of slashing damage. On top of being attacked by
    trees, roll a d8 and if you roll >6, they will be attacked by the following:
    - d4
      - 1-2: ghast
      - 3-4: ghoul
    - d4 for the number of them

      This can happen up to a d6 amount of times.


    At the end of the attacks, they will appear in front of a gated manor. The
    gate is an iron rod fence, along with an iron rod gate. The manor looks just
    like a typical haunted house, except there is a symbol at the top of the
    doorway into the manor. It is a circle with two triangles in it. See [[file://~/org/dnd/dracon.png][this]]
    image for a reference. Another thing that they notice is that there is a
    thick fog rolling in. In fact, you can barely see more than 10 ft in front
    of you.


    As you approach the manor, you get another eerie feeling and thoughts of
    going back enter your head again. Once again, everyone must roll an charisma
    saving throw >15 or think that they should go back. If they do decide to go
    back, they must go through the same stuff as before on the way out.


    If they stay, they will see a large double door. Each door has two slots on
    it. One has an image of a skull, the other a red drop of blood. There is
    also a set of door knockers, one on each door. They are in the shape of
    skulls as well and look as if they are made of of brass that hasn't been
    cleaned in approximately a century. There are no handles on the doors. You
    find this very strange.

    They will most likely use the knockers. At which nothing will happen. They
    can try all they want, the doors will not open without a lot of force. They
    can attempt to knock the doors in and will only succeed with a Str check
    >18. Otherwise, they need to find another way in. Also, if they enter by
    breaking the doors, they will have worse luck in the manor.


    Skip over this part if they break the doors down, just jump to the part when
    they enter the manor with the blood and death coins. Keep in mind, since
    they broke the doors down, when they get to the boss, he won't be as
    friendly. [[Let the Games Begin]]

    --------------------------------------

    They can walk around the manor. On the /west/ side of the manor, they will
    find a grave yard that is attached to the fence around the manor. If they
    enter the yard then they will be attacked by d20 of zombies. Otherwise, they
    will be safe. There is nothing of interest on the west side of the manor
    however. On the /east/ side, there will be a cellar door that leads to the
    basement. It does not have a handle on it either. There is a similar slot on
    this door, except it has a grave stone above it. If they do an inspection on
    the door and roll >17, they will notice that the gravestone is very
    intricate and has the words "Here lies Number 1" on it. On the back on the
    manor, there is a porch area that you can get on. There are no windows that
    you can see into and the back door has no handle. It, once again, has a slot
    like the rest. This one has what looks like a casket on it. The casket
    doesn't have any writing on it. If they search the porch, they will find
    some furniture that is very old, and that is all.

    They can find both of the coins for these doors in the graveyard. The
    easiest to find is the cellar door. However, it is the hardest path. The
    casket one is found in a grave that has a casket in it. In order to find it
    you must dig up all the graves until you find it. There are 20 graves, so,
    if you roll a d20 and get 3, you find it. To make things easier, if they
    search and get down to 12, switch to a d12. This is design to make them give
    up so they don't find it. Finding the grave with the gravestone coin doesn't
    require a roll.


    Jump to the respective area in [[Let the Games Begin]] to continue from
    here. Note that if they used the cellar coin, they will had a harder time
    because they will have another floor to complete. If they get in on the
    porch, it is just like they came in the front with the regular coins.

*** Fish People
    Read the entrance stuff found the in [[file://~/org/dnd/places.org][places]] file.


    Once they get to the water, and decide what they're gonna do, d8 fish people
    will jump out of the water. One will say: "Who are you?! And how did you
    find this place!?"

    With a good enough answer, the same one will say: "Aye, I see. Well, before
    you are able to use this passage, you must agree to our code of conduct."

    If they are okay with they, it will say: "It is so. Follow us... Oh, it is
    probably faster for you folk to just walk for now. Once you've agreed to the
    conduct, you will be allowed to use the water."

    They begin to head down the left, however, since you are underground, you
    don't know which cardinal direction it is. It is quite a long trip, in fact,
    the fish people tell you to rest at one point. In actuality, the trip took 1
    day.

    Fish person: "We are here. You land folk go to that ladder over there, we
    will open the hole for you."

    The ladder is wooden, and is made from a tree that must thrive in moist dark
    areas because it doesn't show any signs of rot or ware. After a few minutes,
    a hole in the roof begins to appear. To your surprise, there is no light
    from the sun or anything. The fish person tells you to come up.

    Once you reach the surface, you will realize that you're in a swamp. The
    fish people cover up the hole and begin to walk. After a few minutes, you
    see a village. It is quite large actually. It looks almost like a tribal
    swamp village, but with fish people. The village is on top of very wet
    land. It's basically a marsh. There is also a lot of water around the
    village that looks very deep. The houses and buildings look to be made out
    of the same material as the ladder. It is very dark in color, and looks like
    most of the other trees around the area. There are a lot of fish people
    walking around that take a minute to stare at you. Then resume what they
    were doing after a minute or so.

    Fish person: "Come into our headquarter. We shall discuss the code with you
    in there. "

    They lead you to a longer building. There are no signs or anything to make
    it stand out. Whence entered, you notice that the floor is literally the
    same ground as outside and that it is just one large room. At the end of the
    room are 5 fish people. Each dressed the same as everyone else. You also
    notice that there is a portrait of another fish guy on the wall. He is quite
    fat and doesn't have legs. He is doesn't look anything like the fish people
    that you are with, however. He is wearing a white shirt, and a blue
    sleeveless jacket. There is also a band around his waist that has a purple
    gem in it. After you've looked around one of the fish people at the front of
    the room says: "Ayo, travelers. Welcome to the Kuo-Toas Village. What have
    ya come for?"

    "Yes, you wish to use the Underground River. Indeed. This doesn't free, ya
    know. You must first agree to the code of conduct. After which, you must
    take a test about the code. Lastly, to prove your loyalness, a simple
    quest. Do you accept these conditions?"

    "Okay, then. Let us get started... There are 5 rules that you must abide by:
    1. You must not talk about the river to anyone besides us and yourselves.
    2. You must not bring others into the river besides us and yourselves.
    3. You must make sure that no one is following you and that the coast is
       clear before you enter or exit the river cave.
    4. You must not use the river as a getaway for crimes or other illegal
       activity.
    5. You must pay a tax to us, the Kuo-Toas, if you wish to have us guide you
       in the river.

       Do you accept these conditions?"


    If no, it will say: "Then you must not use the river. You will now be taking
    into our brainwashing room to have your memories of the river erased."

    Otherwise, "Good, good. Do you have any questions about the code of
    conduct?"

    "Okay, we shall test you now. Take these folks to the testing center
    (talking to the people that brought you in)."


    You are then taken to a smaller building that looks just like the rest of
    them. One of the fish people that guided you there will say: "Here it
    is... Good luck."

    You will enter into a room with one person in it. Just like the last place,
    it is just one room and the floor is the ground from outside. The person
    standing in the room says:

    "Hi. I am Yu-Ye. I will be your instructor. The test you are about to take
    will be like nothing you've previously experienced. I ask you all to close
    your eyes and think about the code of conduct that was spoken to you not
    long ago. Each one of the rules is important, but which one is the most
    important? Do not answer out loud. Just think about which one you think is
    the most important. Once you've decided, open your eyes. Look around, take
    in the surroundings. If you have the correct answer, you will know in your
    heart. You will feel a sense of joy. If you have the wrong answer, you will
    have haste and anger in your heart. In fact, you might not feel anything in
    your heart. This means you are probably ignoring what I am saying. This is
    because you are naive and full of yourself. Someone like that cannot pass
    this test. Only those whom feel the joy in their heart can pass."

    At this point, the group should roll a Charisma check. If >15, they are not
    disturbed and continue to listen. Otherwise, they start to get pissed
    off. They are ready to be tested.... Not this stupid hippy shit!!

    It continues: "Breathe in and let the swampy air in. If the air feels cold
    and harsh, then you shall not be admitted into the river. You fail. If,
    however, the air gives you a feeling of contentment, you are on your way to
    succeeding the test. At this point, think about where you came from. Think
    about the things you learned about as a child. Where those thing good? Do
    they make you happy? If not, this is okay. For sometimes we come from
    incorrect paths. There is only 1 path on this planet. That is the path of
    the *Kuuruubara*, the great god of this land. He rules it over with a mighty
    fist. Not afraid to smite any creature that doesn't obey his command!"

    Once more, roll a Charisma check. If >18, you start to question what the
    hell is going on. Otherwise, you buy this shit. Even if you were pissed a
    moment ago, you start to think "Hmm, this might get interesting."

    "Think to yourselves. Are you following the order of the Grand Kuuruubara?
    Those of you who are not, beware! For you are walking on dangerous grounds!
    Release your sorrows and sins now!!! Now bow and pray to Kuuruubara, for he
    awaits worship."

    If they bow down and worship him, their god will be angry at them (if they
    follow one). They will then pass the test. He will say: "Congratulations!
    You've passed the test. Please go see the elders once more."

    If they DO NOT bow down:

    "You have dishonored Kuuruubara!!! You will surely be punished for your
    actions!!! Kuuruubara SMITE THESE FOOLS!!"

    At that moment, the water begins to rise. "Ohhhhh, you will surely be
    punished now!"

    The water will rise by about 5ft and stop. "Bow to him now, or he will drown
    you all! We know you land creatures don't know how to swim!!!"

    If they bow, it will stop. Otherwise, it will begin to rise after their
    turn.

    It will stop again at 10ft, "If you do not bow now, I'm afraid +we+ he, will
    have to destroy you!"

    At this point, they can barely hang in there. The water is so deep and they
    can't swim. However, at this point they are able to just barely breathe.

    If they call him out on this Freudian slip, he will defend himself. They can
    convince him that the god isn't real with a persuasion >16. At which, he
    will stop the flood and ask them how they know that he isn't real.

    If they bow, he will stop the madness and tell them that they passed.

    If they don't do either, the water will rise to 20ft, and they will drown.

    --------------------------------------

    No matter what, they will go to or awake in the elder's building. What they
    say will be different however.

    If they passed:
    "Congratulations travelers. You have passed the test. I hope you found it as
    challenging as we designed it to be. It is time for a small quest. The quest
    that we've selected for you is quite simple actually. All we need you to do,
    is clear up the river so that we can have control over the Kelczar exit. Our
    arch enemies control that, and all of the, the river. We want that Kelczar
    exit, however. Complete that task and you shall be free to roam the river as
    you wish. Just remember, you must pay if you wish to have our people guide
    you. What do you think?"

    If they do not accept: "I guess you will not be using the river them. Please
    take these travelers to the brainwashing room so that we can wipe their
    memories of the river."

    If they do, jump to [[Ugly Frog People]].


    If they failed:
    "What a shame... I wouldn't have guess that you would have failed. Sadly, I
    was wrong. Take them to the brainwashing room and have their memories of the
    river removed. Then take them out to the swamp, and leave them there. I am
    sorry, travelers, we must do what we must do."

    *If they attempt to start a fight, they will be forced to fight the entire
    village. There are a d20 (13) standard Kuo-Toas, a d20 (8) of Kuo-Toa Whips,
    and a d4 of Kuo-Toa Archpriests. Good luck. If defeated, they will wake up
    in the swamp with the village nowhere to be found. If successful, they
    conquered the entire Kuo-Toa village. They now own the land, however, the
    people left hate them and will attempt to assassinate them at any
    opportunity. This will also cause /Gury/ to be enemies of them, since he
    secretly is the ruler.*

    --------------------------------------

    They will be taken to another building. It will once again, be an open
    single room. There will be 1 person in there with a cauldron that is sitting
    on top of a fire. The person will say: "It is quite foul tasting but it will
    do the trick. Please do not hesitate, or I will be require to use force."

    They will be walked towards the person. He will get a small bowl full of the
    bluish-gray colored liquid inside of the cauldron and take to the first
    person. One by one, will be forced to drink the hot liquid. It tastes like
    hot water that was mixed with chalk, with a hint of lemon. Each person must
    roll a constitution saving throw. If >20, you pass, and are not affected by
    the potion. Otherwise you will immediately forget where you are and what is
    going on.

    You will then be taken far into the woods and told to never return to the
    village.

    :end of quest

**** Ugly Frog People
     "Alright, we will supply you with some guides to take you to the places
     that need to be cleared. They, however, will do no fighting. For we cannot
     risk having our men killed by the brutes that rule those regions of the
     river."

     Once accepted, they will taken to the river entrance that they were brought
     out of.


     You be brought a small boat to allow for faster traveling. One of the
     Kuo-Toas that came with you will say: "Everyone get in this boat. It will
     allow us to move at a faster rate." (That rate is about 4x the normal
     speed. 1 day of walking will only take about 6hrs)

     Once you are all in the boat, it will begin to move. The Kuo-Toas that are
     following use a spell to make the river move. This allows you to go very
     fast. You will travel for about 2 days and the flowing will stop. One of
     the Kuo-Toas will say: "Here is where we must stop. Ahead, about 3 hours,
     will be the people you must destroy. I should note that the Slaadi are NOT
     friendly and will probably attack you right away. If not, consider
     yourselves lucky. Good luck."

     They will then travel about 3 hours on foot. When they will hear a voice
     inside their heads. It will tell them to turn around or they will need to
     use force.

     I'm sure they will keep going and they will be met with two slaadi, both
     red. One will be on each side of the river. However, on the first turn of
     the one across the river, it will jump over to the other side where you
     are. Once they are defeated, they can take a short rest. However, after a
     few minutes of rest, they will met by a larger slaad, this one is blue. It
     has large claws that protrude from its hands. It speaks:

     "You have defeated my friends... They have been guarding this exit for 20
     years and no one has ever defeated them... What is it that you want from
     the exit?"

     If they say something about working for or doing a quest for the Kuo-Toa,
     he will say: "The Kuo-Toa are our worst enemy. They think that they can
     rule this river, but the truth is that they are weak. They must have
     tricked you into thinking that it was possible to defeat us. That is
     laughable. Here is what I'll do for you: I will let you live, if and only
     if, you join us and help us destroy the Kuo-Toa!"

     If they agree, they will have a much easier fight. Since the Slaadi are
     significantly stronger than the Kuo-Toa, the fight will not be too
     bad. However, it will be more like a war. Jump to [[War of the Underground
     River]].

     If they don't: "Well, I guess you choose to fight for the weak. Prepare
     yourself for battle!"

     They will then fight him.

     If they succeed, then they will continue onward. It is recommended that
     they take a long rest at this point because they will probably get fucked
     if they continue without a rest. As they travel farther, they will
     eventually hit a trap. It is a water trap that will force you into the
     river. Unless detected with a investigation >9, they will be forced to roll
     a Dex saving throw (yes all of them). If >12, they pass and are not pushed
     into the water. Otherwise, they will be pushed into the water. If someone
     cannot rescue them, they will drown. After this trap, the rest of the way
     is fairly smooth.


     After a few more hours of travel, they will see one Slaad standing. Just
     standing. One they get close enough, it will speak:

     "You know it is comedic to think that the Kuo-Toa will ever take over the
     river. Do any of you know anything about the Kuo-Toa?"

     "Exactly. Let me explain. Many years ago, the Kuo-Toa were normal land
     dwelling people. Due to their weak minds, they were easy to turn into
     slaves. Any creature capable would capture them and force them into
     slavery. After centuries of being slaves, they broke. Generation after
     generation, the Kuo-Toa grew more and more insane. Until they became so
     sickened, that they were useless, even as slaves. To this day, they suffer
     from insanity; making up gods and rules out of thin air. They truthfully
     have no idea what is going on. They trust no one except themselves and
     their false gods. In the end, Kuo-Toa are useless creatures that are using
     you to "accomplish" something. When in reality, that "something" isn't
     really anything at all. They don't want more of the river, they just think
     that they do. Now, I will ask you all a question. Will you abandon the
     Kuo-Toa that are using you and join us in removing their filth from this
     land?"

     If yes, jump to [[War of the Underground River]].

     If no, "Okay. Just remember that I told you those freaks were going to
     screw you over! Prepare yourselves travelers!"

     At that moment, a ball of fire will be hurled at someone. I pick. While the
     fire was near him, you could see that he was green in color and had a
     staff.


     If they succeed in defeating the creature, they have technically completed
     the quest. However, they must still go back and bring the Kuo-Toas that
     guided them to the cleared exit. When this is done one of them will say:

     "Great! Great! Let us go back and tell the elders of your success."

     --------------------------------------

     They will all travel back to the village peacefully and return to the
     elders. Whence you enter the room: "I suppose this means that you folks
     completed the task?"

     "Very good. We have decided that we didn't think that clearing the Kelczar
     exit was good enough... Thus, we have added another quest to the
     requirements. Please clear the Vet'ric exit now."

     If they agree, it will basically be the same thing. Just improvise and use
     harder Slaadi.

     If not, "Well then, I guess we will have to wipe your memories. We really
     thought that you guys would have been useful to us... Please take them to
     the brainwashing room!"

     Read the brainwashing stuff from earlier.

     --------------------------------------

     This will go on until they have defeated all the exit Slaadi guards. This
     obviously isn't something that they would want to do because it is
     unnecessary work, so they will probably want to stop. There are a few basic
     ways to get out of the loop:
     1. Turn on the Kuo-Toas and kill them all.
        1. Use the stuff from before if they do this.
     2. Join the Slaadi and kill the Kuo-Toa.
        1. Jump to [[War of the Underground River]]
     3. Leave and don't use the Underground river.
        1. This will leave them unable to use the river and disliked by both the
           Slaadi and the Kuo-Toa. However, they won't have to deal with the war
           and will be able to continue the main quest.
     4. Something creative that would work.


     This quest is technically finished if you kill them all or finish all their
     biddings.

     :end of quest

***** War of the Underground River

      Depending on when you are joining the Slaadi will determine how exactly it
      will start up. Basically, it will all start the same but the person is
      different. This is assuming that they are joining the Green Slaadi at the
      Kelczar exit.

      Slaad: "You have made a wise choice. Follow me."

      At that moment, the Slaad will say some words and a purple-colored portal
      will appear on the ground.

      "Let's go." and he will jump in.

      --------------------------------------

      You will then jump out the other end of the portal in a very odd house of
      sorts. The place seems very woodland-ish. The room is constructed of a
      dark wood and the floor is grassy and moist. It smells like you are
      located deep within a forest that has had a recent rain.

      Once you've all collected your thoughts, the Slaad will say: "Stay in here
      for a little while. I will come back and tell you when it is time to show
      yourselves. In the mean time, rest and regain your strength, for my people
      might want a show of strength to make sure you are all capable of taking
      down the Kuo-Toa."


      About an hour will pass and the Slaad will return. He will say: "Come out,
      warriors, for it is time for your exposure."

      You will be lead out of the small hut and outside there will be hundreds
      of Slaadi standing around the hut. All different colors, red, blue, green,
      and gray. They will all start to cheer once you're out! Once they've all
      settled down, the green Slaad will speak, this time in a different language
      that you cannot understand. After he finishes, the entire crowd will begin
      to cheer again. He will then turn to you and say:

      "They want a show, good luck."

      He will then scream something else in that other language and everyone
      else will start to cheer again. The green Slaad will then merge into the
      crowd.


      Then the cheering will stop. You wait. During this time, you look around
      and notice that you are deep in the forest. The trees around you are quite
      large with very thick trunks. The tops of the trees must be 50 yards up!!
      The rest of the village, as you can see, is a mixture of huts similar to
      the one you were in. You also notice that the huts seem to be like little
      trees with leaves growing on top, how odd.

      After a few minutes, you begin to hear something... The crowd begins to
      cheer again and eventually, the crowd in front of you starts to
      split. Then you see it.... A medium sized monster that none of you have
      ever seen before. It has 3 legs, 3 arms, 1 eye, and a huge mouth. The skin
      is a reddish-brown and is being guided by 3 strange looking Slaadi. They
      aren't gray, but a very dark gray, almost black. You are unsure why the
      creature doesn't just break free and fight, but it seems that it is being
      controlled by something to keep it calm.

      Once the creature enters the center, the 3 black Slaadi away and the
      creature springs into action! It screeches a terrifying screech and the
      battle begins.

      --------------------------------------

      If they win against the beast, the crowd will go nuts. The green Slaad
      will come to you and say: "You have defeated the
      Xorn. Congratulations. You have now proven yourselves to us. You are now a
      member of the Slaadi army. **yelling** We shall go tomorrow and rid this
      land of the filth that is the Kuo-Toa!!!"

      The crowd will go nuts and slowly they will return to their quarters to
      prepare for tomorrow's pillage. You can ask the green Slaadi questions but
      you are not welcome to roam the town.

      --------------------------------------

      The next day, you will all jump through a portal and end up deep in the
      swamp somewhere. The leader that has been assigned to your squad is a
      black Slaad, he will point to the direction you will go. You and the rest
      of the squad will join.

      After about an hour of walking, you see the village. The black Slaad will
      scream something in Slaadi and start to run, and so will everyone else.


      Let the war begin! You reach the village were you see Slaadi and Kuo-Toa
      fighting. The watery ground is red from the blood. You are then spotted by
      the elders. One of them will yell: "TRADERS!!!!!!" Then you will fight all
      4 of them. However, you get the squad too, which consists of 1 black, 1
      grey, and 2 red Slaadi. You should be able to win pretty easily. Every 5
      turns roll a d4, if 1-2 a d6 of Kuo-Toa join, if 3-4 a d4 of Kuo-Toa Whips
      join.

      --------------------------------------

      Once the battle has finished, you will notice that the entire town has
      been destroyed. One of the dying elders will say:

      "You will all be punished... The great Gury will kill you all..." Then it
      dies.

      Afterwards, the black Slaad yell something in Slaadi and a green Slaad
      will come over. It will say to you: "Thank you for your help. We greatly
      appreciate the help... Now, let us go back to the village and rest, we
      have a surprise for you...."

      --------------------------------------

      Once back to the village, you are taken into a larger hut. Inside is a
      very strange pool of water. Inside of the pool are a bunch of gems; red,
      blue, green, gray, and black. The green Slaad with you says:

      "These are called Control Stones. They can be used to control others, or
      protect you from being controlled. You see, us Slaadi use these stones and
      we wish to give you some. However, you don't get to choose if you want one
      or not..."

      At that moment 3 black Slaadi enter the room.

      "We are truly sorry for the inconvenience... but we need men that are as
      powerful as you to fight for us... How else would we be able to overthrow
      the scum that is the Rellekka Empire?"

      Then in Slaadi, it will tell the black Slaadi to attack. They will
      definitely lose...

      --------------------------------------

      They awake in a fancy inn. Confused and disoriented.


      If they go downstairs, they will realize they are back in Lum'is,
      specifically in the Lum'is Inn. If they ask the innkeeper how they got
      here he will say:

      "I am not sure... We had some guest go up to what-was-supposed-to be empty
      room and you were all in there, with the payment on the counter. We truly
      have no idea how you all got here."

      --------------------------------------

      They each have a gem that has been implanted in them at some place on
      their body, namely their backs. It should be noted that they are now
      controlled by the controller of the Slaadi, The Elder Brain. If they
      attempt to do something that it doesn't want them to do, it will stop
      them. If they attempt to break the gem, it could kill them due to it being
      embedded into their spinal cords. (It is different for Ryk'k. His is
      simply floating inside his slug-like body) They can get them destroyed the
      same way that a Slaadi's can be destroyed.


      :end of quest

*** Let the Games Begin

    In order to get to Kelczar, they must pay the Kelczarian guard 50g. This
    will guarantee them save travel to the major city. Otherwise, they would
    have to try and get there themselves and they would die in the desert.

    The trip to the major city, Balckyeti, will take about 9 days of travel. The
    guy will take you and give you all the food you need for the trip.


    As promised, the trip will be safe. We can skip over this part, but here is
    a description:

    To the east you see a beautiful ocean. The waves a full and the water is
    blue. You can smell the salt water from where you are. To the west, you see
    nothing but sand. For miles and miles, flat sand. The sand is a bright
    yellow and looking at it is almost as bad as looking forward due to the
    sun's brightness. The sun beating down on you is starting to make you weak
    as you walk, but the Kelczarian guide has provided you with plenty of water
    to stay hydrated.

    --------------------------------------

    After the 9 day trip, you arrive in an amazing city. The buildings are HUGE!
    You've never seen anything like this before. They are all made out of some
    sandstone or something, but each have their own unique style. The smaller
    buildings are square and the larger ones are rectangular. Then, you see a
    giant palace of sorts. It has a huge set of stairs that led up to a palace
    thing. The top palace has pillars holding it up and on top are very odd
    ornament shaped things. The guide takes you up the stairs.

    After a long travel up the stairs, there are 2 guards wearing fancy
    armor. They are wearing breastplates, armored skirt-like things, armored
    sandals, and turbans. Their weapons are some kind of spear with very unique
    tips on them. You are not sure what exactly they are. One of them asks:

    "Who are these people?"

    Guide: "These folks would like to speak with the Queen."

    Guard: "What about?"

    Guide: "A quest. They are in search of rare coins"

    Guard: "Indeed. Ahaharia! Come here!"

    Another guard in the same attire comes.

    Ahaharia: "Yes, Alijam?"

    Alijam: "Ask the Queen if she is willing to talking with some travelers."

    Ahaharia: "Yes."

    And he leaves.


    A few minutes later, he returns and says that she /is/ willing.

    Alijam: "Very well. You may leave now, they will follow us. (said to the
    guide) Follow us, travelers."

    --------------------------------------

    You are taken inside the palace. The inside is just as beautiful as the
    outside. The walls are constructed of the same material as the outside. The
    floor has a bright red rug that travels all the way down the hallway. At the
    end of the hallway, there are 2 large doors. The guard opens them and in a
    large room sits a queen on a golden thrown that is up on a tier of
    sorts. There are 2 others with her. She is wearing a purple dress, with
    golden laced sandals, a golden belt, golden gauntlets, and a bunch of other
    golden jewelry including rings, bracelets, necklaces, and a tiara-like head
    necklace that is around her forehead. She looks as if she is human, but her
    eyes of that of a snake and her tongue is that of a snake. The others on the
    lower tiers look similar, except one is male. Inside the room are a mixture
    of other things. Along the side walls are 6 guards (3 on each side). They
    are standing in front of what look like doorways but there are just walls
    there. Behind you are 2 more guards. The guards themselves are not human. In
    fact, they are 100% snake-like. The queen then speaks:

    She speaks in a snake-like whisper:

    "Greetings travelers, how are you doing on this fine day?"

    "I am Queen Ahkilah. I rule the lands of Kelczar. Welcome. What is it that
    you were looking for?"

    "Oh, I see. Coins. I believe we have a large quantity of coins. However,
    they are not for sale."

    The queen will basically try to get them to go away and that they cannot do
    anything for her to give them to her.

    If they say anything rude to her or try to attack her, the guards will
    spring into action.

    If they leave, they will have to pay another guide to take them back to
    Lum'is or they can try and steal the coins.


    Whenever they do something to piss off the government (and they will, just
    for being foreigners that aren't with a guide) they will be attacked by the
    guards, 6 of them to be exact. Use the Yuan-Ti Abomination as the guards,
    except they will have spear with petrifaction tips. On a successful attack
    roll, the target must roll a Constitution saving throw >13 or become
    petrified.

    --------------------------------------

    You will awake in a strange room. The walls are decorated with fancy gylphs
    and other golden artwork. The ground is the same sandstone from the rest of
    the damn place. Looking up, you realize that you're in a very deep hole. It
    looks as though you're a mile underground... You also notice all your stuff
    is gone.

    The next thing you realize is that Ryk'k is missing but there is another
    person in the hole with you. A small creature, sitting on the floor with a
    hood over its head. It speaks:

    "I think I remember you fellas... And I bet you'll remember me too."

    He removes his hood to reveal that it's Wart!!

    If they ask how he got down here:

    "Well, it's a long story. However, I was planning on stealing something
    very important to the Kelczarians. Needless to say, I was caught. Normally,
    I would have been able to kill the guards but they've got balls of steel and
    some wicked *Petrifaction Tips*."

    If they ask what those are:

    "Petrifaction tips are a special tip that they put on their spears. It uses
    some special chemical that the fucking Kelczarians created. They realized
    that they suck at metal working, but they're great with drugs and
    chemicals. So they made that shit. I'd love to get a hold of some but that's
    risking it."

    If they ask about what is gonna happen or something similar:

    "Kelczarians are sick mother fuckers. They like to eat each other and
    shit. But one thing that they like to do is watch people get ripped to
    shreds. So, they build this grandiose fucking coliseum so they can watch
    people get killed. That's basically where we are going."

    "Last time I checked, they just got a new Hydra... They bought the fuckin
    thing for like a handful of Solidaria... Goddam morals, so stupid."

    If they ask about Solidaria:

    "Solidaria is a drug. A very very bad drug. The drug allows you to remain
    "high" for days at a time. You see, you can't digest solidaria. I don't
    know of any creature that can. So it sits in you stomach and poisons you
    until you shit it out. The problem is that it's highly addictive *and*
    slowly kills you. It's one of the most expensive drugs on the market and
    people will do *anything* for it."

    If they ask how long they'll be down there:

    "Could be as long as a month. It depends on how long it takes for the word
    to get out. They've gotta tell every fucker in the Kelczarian territory
    about it. It's like a goddam holiday for them."


    They will be down there for approximately 2 months. They will be fed by
    falling food that they drop down. During this time they can choose to do all
    sorts of things. Let them pick and make something nice happen.

    --------------------------------------

    Two months later...

    --------------------------------------

    to be continued...
** Spies of Dracon
   The premise of this quest is to basically find out information about the
   underground business that is going on in the Lum'is kingdom. Lord Dracon has
   information that the kingdom is partaking in some strange activity with some
   underground business.

   There isn't a particular person that they need to find, all they need is to
   find someone who is involved and bring that person to Lord Dracon.

   There are 2 main things to look for when searching for someone:
   1.) The devil star necklace
   2.) Catching a royal person (king, siqure, historian, any royal figure)
   talking to a strange person.

   This won't be easy but if they are able to notice the many people with the
   devil star necklace, they might be able to catch on.

   --------------------------------------

   If they do capture a person, they won't be easy to get information out
   of. These people are mindless drones of the devil and won't spill the beans
   with the breaking of the devil's mind trickery. If they get said person to
   Lord Dracon, he will take the person without letting the party hear what that
   person has to say. However, Lord Dracon's information /is/ correct, there is
   an underground business. If they are good enough, they could persuade Lord
   Dracon into telling them information at another time (for completing the
   mission, the team will become friends with the Dracons and get granted access
   to the mansion at all time. They can sleep and eat there too.) If they sleep
   there, the next morning they can ask the Lord for information on the
   person. They must succeed a persuation check to get the info.

   Succeed: He will tell them that the person was under a very powerful spell
   that was controlling his mind. Whomever set the spell knew what they were
   doing because when I released the spell, the person's mind was
   erased. Once they came to, I asked them what they knew. The person only
   remembered the last moments before the spell was set. The story goes like
   this:
   "I was a serf under the Vet'ric kindgom living a terrible life. A
   strange person came to my hut one day and asked if I wanted to be free. Of
   course I said yes. I was then taken into a cave of sorts and into a dark room
   made of stone. I don't have many details because I was getting really worried
   at this point. I was placed in the middle of some circle or something and the
   person did some kind of summoning spell. A very scary creature was summoned,
   but I couldn't see. That is all I remember."

   After they discuss whatever, Lord Dracon will ask them if they want to help
   him figure out more about this. If yes, they will continue this quest. If no,
   they stop here.

   Either way, he will offer them some gives for helping out: (each person
   pick 1)
   - Wand of Force Bolt
   - Wand of Necro Bolt
   - Wand of Blink
   - Wand of Uncharge
   - Nerco Enchantment on 1 item
   - Blood Enchantment on 1 item
   - Fang Blade
   - Skullhandled Executioner Blade
   - Shovel of Superior Digging
   - Wooden Stake Bolts
   - Potion of Blood
   - Potion of Temporary Death
   - Potion of Undead Turn
   - Potion of Bat Polymorph
   - Ring of Undead Control
   - Pocket Coffen (Like a bag of holding but a coffen)
