#+TITLE: Place Descriptions

* Lum'is Region
	The Lum'is region is a place that consists mostly of forest, swamp, and some
	undead forest. Each special place is described below.

** Port Santus
	 The first thing you notice about the port is that it is huge. There are about
	 20, maybe more, ports for large ships. The dock is made out of a very clean
	 light colored wood. It looks quite new and fresh looking. Docked at the port
	 are very large ships that you've never seen before. The ships look like they
	 would be used for hauling cargo of some sort.

	 Beyond the dock you see a small town consisting of maybe 5 or 6
	 buildings. All of which are quite small except one of them, which looks like
	 an inn of some sort. All the buildings look exactly the same and there aren't
	 any signs, that you can see, depicting what each building is for. The
	 buildings are made out of a gray stone and topped off with a reddish colored
	 roofing. They all have the same exact layout, two windows in the front, split
	 by a large wooden door.

	 Once you've taken in the appearance of the place, you realize that there
	 isn't a soul around (unless they are just getting in, then there is a small
	 crew helping secure their boat and two fancy looking gentlemen). It gives the
	 place an eerie feeling.

	 Buildings:
    - Tally'an and Topiz's House
			- You cannot tell what this building is.
		- [[file:items.org::*Kyle's%20Food%20Store][Kyle's Food Store]]
			- A medium-sized entirely constructed of wood building. There is a small
				wooden sign above the singular door that reads "Kyle's Food Store".
		- [[file:items.org::*Port%20Santus%20Brewery][Port Santus Brewery]]
			- Similar to the food store, this place is also entirely constructed of
				wood. You can tell it's a bar because there is a sign hanging with 2
				pints of ale clicking together.
		- [[file:items.org::*Dirty%20Janet's%20Inn][Dirty Janet's Inn]] (attached to the brewery)
			- Attached to the bar is a larger building that is, maybe, 3 stories
				high. It has a sign that reads "Inn" nailed above the double doors that
				leads in.
		- [[file:items.org::*Heave%20&%20Hoe:%20A%20Sailors'%20Shop][Heave & Hoe: A Sailors' Shop]]
			- Just like the rest of the places, it is constructed entirely of
				wood. There is a sign that has what looks like a boat on it nailed to the
				side of the construct.
		- Port's Crew Barracks
			- You cannot tell what this building is

*** First Encounter Scene
		The two fancy gentlemen are *Topiz* and *Tally'an* the owners of the port and
		port town. They are both dressed in a similar fashion, *Topiz* wearing a
		purple coat with a white fluffy ascot and straight brown trousers and
		*Tally'an* wearing a brown vest with a white shirt under and similar brown
		trousers. Topiz is smoking from a pipe and has no facial hear or hat on. In
		fact, he is completely bald. Tally'an has a gote√® and is wearing a brown flat
		cap.

		Upon meeting them Topiz will say in a Scottish-like accent:
		"Welcome ye travelers! Welcome to Port Santus, the biggest port in all the
		lands! Let us help ye get settled!"

		**orders crew to help**

		After they are settled:

		Tally'an: (also Scottish yet slight deeper than Topiz) "Greetings travelers,
		I am Tally'an and this is me brother Topiz. We own this port. What have ye
		docked for?"

		If they say something about looking for a quest:
		- Both men will look at each other and Tally'an will say: "I'll be right
      back, I need to take a look at something. I believe that I know someone
      who is in need of some help."
		- Topiz will shoot the shit with them until Tally'an gets back.
		- Tally'an returns and whispers in the ear of Topiz. Topiz will then say
      "Alrighty, the man with quest is the king of Lum'is. He rules these
      lands. His castle is found that way (pointing east) and takes about 3 days
      of travel to get there. We outta rest up before we head out! Take the day
      off, walk around town, and enjoy the weather. You can stay in the inn for
      the evening, gratis. We will embark to Lum'is at dawn."

		--------------------------------------

    Once awake then next morning, they must find Topiz and Tally'an. They'll be
    outside packing somethings into their backpacks.

    Topiz: "We will be your guides to Lum'is! Do not worry, it is a safe
    journey. If you have any questions, feel free to ask 'em!"

		They begin their journey by going directly east of the port. They enter a
		very wooded area and are walking on a very neat and clean looking dirt
		road. The road seems to be going straight for miles and miles. As far as you
		can see. The trees are tall and full of life. The forest is very thick in
		both directions (left or north and right or south).

		Roll a d4, 4 times. If 4, you see another traveler going to opposite
		way. You may talk to them if you wish.

		On the first night, right after the sun goes down, they begin to notice that
		there is a lot of bat activity in this forest. They hear screeching from the
		bats and see a lot of them flying around. Odd.

		During the 2 day day, after the 2nd d4 roll, have them all roll a perception
		check of DC 1. If passed, they notice that there is a strange looking place
		to the left of them. Strangely, you can see the place because there is a
		very very small path that leads directly to it. The place is quite far away,
		maybe about 1 mile away. The place is /huge/, dark, and scary looking. You
		can see that there is a rod fence around the place that you can barely
		see. Surrounding the place are black dead trees.

		If they ask about it:

		Topiz: "Aye, that is *Dracon Manor*. The Dracons keep all the land of Lum'is
		safe from any evil. That is how they pay tax to the king. Don't worry they
		don't hurt you unless you try to hurt someone else or cause trouble on
		Lum'is ground. I wouldn't recommend going to their manor, however. They
		don't like visitors."

		If they say something about who they are:

		Topiz: "They are a clan of vampires. Their leader is a vampire by the name
		of *Draculim*, he is a business man of sorts... But I don't recommend doing
		business with him..."

		Go to [[City of Lum'is]] whence they see the walls of the castle.

** City of Lum'is
	 (This is not descibing the castle at all. Goto [[Castle]] for that.)

	 Upon enter the city, you notice that the amount of trees surrounding you is
	 lessening. To the right, you see the castle wall. To the left, a large farm.
	 You can see that in the fenced-in area are cows and sheep. The barn for the
	 farm is quite large and is painted a hideous green color. There is also a
	 small wooden house that is facing the opposite direction of you.

	 As you stroll more and more into town, you notice more small buildings. To
	 your right but in front of the castle wall, you see a small store of some
	 kind. The store is on a corner that splits off in two directions left and
	 right (north and south). To the left you see a road that goes on for a very
	 long time. You can also see the front of the farm house. Also to the left but
	 on the right side on the street you see another building that looks identical
	 to the store from earlier. You cannot tell what it is for. Right next to
	 that, which is right in front of you in the middle of the intersection, is a
	 blacksmith's shop. You can hear the ting tanging of the man working hard.

	 Going left into the city, you notice there are a lot of people around
	 here. It's quite noisy. Not to mention, there is this idiot on a stump right
	 outside of the blacksmith's place screaming about something. He is saying:
	 "War, war, and more war! The thousand year war continues!" then you stop
	 listening. You are now standing in front of the opening to the castle. Behind
	 you is a bridge that takes you over a decently sized creek. The bridge is
	 made out of the same stone as the castle and every other goddam thing in this
	 town... If you were to continue going east, you would go deeper into the City
	 of Lum'is. It's not huge and it looks very mundane. The only thing that
	 caught your eye was the church that stood higher than most of the
	 buildings. You also notice a group of buildings that looks very different
	 from rest. They are constructed entirely of wood and stand taller than the
	 others. These are obvious inns. There are about 4 of them all in a row.

	 --------------------------------------

	 On the other side of the bridge, there are only a few houses (about 5) that
	 are in a small cluster on the left side of the road. To the east, you notice
	 an odd looking post that takes you over a small bridge onto what looks like a
	 desert. How odd... To the right, there is a small dock where you see a small
	 group of people fishing. All of these places are met by an intersection. Only
	 the left road continues on for quite some distance. There aren't many trees
	 in this area and after some thought, you realize that this is a very small
	 island. Namely: The Island of Lum'is.

	 If you follow the road to the left (north), you will come to a house that
	 looks like someone of wealth might live there. If you knock on the door no
	 one will answer. However, a small odd looking guy with a hunch back will come
	 out from behind the house and say: "*Gury* isn't home right now, he's out
	 catching some fish. He'll be back in about a month."

*** Castle
		The castle is quite large in size but not the biggest you've ever seen. It
		is constructed out of a gray stone both inside and out. On the outside is a
		large wall that surrounds the entire castle. The wall also has four towers
		found on the each corner. The towers don't look all that nice and are very
		square. Whomever design them design them on functionality and not looks. You
		can't see inside but you assume those are archer towers. Around the wall is
		a mote filled with water. The water, oddly, looks very clean and almost
		drinkable. The front of the castle wall contains a large wooden door that
		acts as a bridge across the mote. It is open and you can see inside of the
		walls.

		On the inside you see the large castle. It is made out of the same gray
		stone as the wall. Being honest, it isn't a very pretty castle. It looks
		rather bland and lacks aesthetic much like the wall towers. The courtyard
		inside the wall is quite large and contains a copious amount of people. It
		looks like they are all walking/standing around talking. Nothing too
		odd. Lastly, you notice that there is a stone path that goes straight toward
		the castle and breaks off in two directions (left and right) in the center
		of the courtyard.

		Once inside the walls, you notice that the courtyard is sectioned off. In
		the main area (center of the yard and toward the opening) is where everyone
		is chatting. To the left, you notice there is a building that looks like
		barracks. You can see the training ground and soldiers training on their
		practice targets. To the right, you see another building however, you cannot
		tell what it is for. Both of these buildings look exactly the same and have
		the same ugliness that the castle and wall have. Lastly, you see that there
		are steps that lead to the entrance of the castle.

** Road to Vet'ric
		The road to Vet'ric is very similar to road from Port Santus to the City
		Lum'is just longer and has more people on it. Every so many miles you see a
		small road that shoots off of the main road. Most of which don't have any
		signs as to where they go.

		About 2 days in, they will see road that curves up north and has a sign that
		says "[[Road to Falendrone]] 6 days on foot"

		Towards the end of the last day of travel, they will see the walls of
		Vet'ric far far away. To the right of them they will see a sign that says
		"Lum'is Horse Farm." The road curves backwards towards the south-east. The
		road to the farm is exactly the same as the road to Vet'ric.

**** Lum'is Horse Farm
		 Upon reaching the farm, you notice that it is quite large in size. There is
		 a large open area that is surrounded by trees. Inside this area there is a
		 large open field that is surrounded by a wooden fence. Inside this area are
		 a plethora of horses, running, jumping, and being trained by a singular man
		 wearing an old cowboy style hat. Towards the back of the field there is a
		 large stable or barn that is crafted of wood and painted a bright
		 orange-red color. It looks quite appealing. At the end of the field to the
		 right is a small house, also made of wood with a stone chimney. You see
		 that there is some smoke coming from the chimney.

** Road to Falendrone
	 The road to Falendrone from Lum'is, is exactly the same as the
	 rest. Peaceful and filled with forest. It takes 3 days to get from the Road
	 to Vet'ric to the road that connects Falendrone with Vet'ric. However, it is
	 quite dangerous to go there since that is the main battle zone for their
	 war. Within the third day of travel, they will hear the noises of
	 war. Tinging and tanging of metal, rawring of summoned monsters, screaming
	 of men dying, etc.

	 The cutoff of Lum'is territory starts 1 day of travel before you reach that
	 road. After that, you're on your own and are no longer protected by the
	 Dracon Clan. The description for the road between Falendrone and Vet'ric can
	 be found [[Road Between Falendrone and Vet'ric][here]].

** Lum'is Swamp
	 The swamp is dark, damp, and, quite frankly, scary. The ground is moist and
	 muddy, the trees are mossy and messy, and the pools of swamp water are murky
	 and topped with algae. You cannot see the sun above you due to the thickness
	 of the trees. The swamp air is heavy and smells quite unique. You hear a lot
	 of small noises consisting of moving animals and other creepy crawlies. The
	 farther you walk, the less and less light you see from the entrance. Once
	 deep enough you need to light a torch or lamp in order to see.

** Dracon Manor
** Lum'is Deep Forest

* Underground River
  This is a river that can take you many places in Lum'is, Falendrone, Vet'ric,
  Kelczar, and many other places on the east side of the continent. There are 3
  openings to the river found in Lum'is, 1 in Falendrone, 1 in Vet'ric, 1 in
  Kelczar, 1 Morytania, 1 in Edgeville, and 1 in Ghosttown. The river is so
  secretive that not even the kings of these places know of it's
  existence. Needless to say, it is /very/ important that you keep it a secret!

  Because the river is pretty much motionless, it is very easy to travel either
  direction. How convenient.

  No matter where you enter from, it is pretty much the same scene. The second
  you open the trapdoor you hear nothing, the smell of fresh water and the
  coolness of the cave rushes out of the door. As you climb down the cold moist
  ladder, you get shivers and light beings to diminish. There is no light
  down. Pitch black. If you can see, good. If not, get a light. The walls the
  cave are moist and dark, so is the ground. As you travel down the hallway, the
  air gets moister. Once you reach the water, you will see a large (about 50yds)
  river that isn't flowing pretty much at all. On both sides of the river, there
  is walking space that is about 10ft in width.

** Lum'is Routes
   Locations:
   - Pu'in's House of Booze Cellar
   - Kuo-Toa Village in the Lum'is Swamps
   - Dracon Manor

   Pretty much everywhere in the Lum'is region is controlled by the
   Kuo-Toas. Once you enter the river "hallway," a d8 of them will jump out of
   the water and demand to know who you are!

** Edgeville and Ghosttown Routes
   Locations:
   - About a 2 day walk from Edgeville, inside the Slaadi village
   - Someplace around Ghosttown


   Pretty much the entire rest of the river is controlled by the Slaadi because
   they are much stronger. They basically let the Kuo-Toa have the Lum'is part.

** Falendrone Route
   This is controlled by the Slaadi but the exit is not open. You can't get out
   that way. To open this you must complete a quest.

** Vet'ric Route
   Controlled by the Slaadi, it exits to a building within the walls of
   Vet'ric. However, it is highly guarded by the Slaadi.

** Morytania Route
   This part of the river collapsed in on itself. It isn't controlled by anyone.

** Kelczar Route
   Once again, controlled by the Slaadi. It exits out in the middle of the
   desert. This is also highly guarded by the Slaadi, but there really isn't a
   reason to have it highly guarded.
