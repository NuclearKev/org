* Attacks
	Wart can't attack with his hands because he's so weak. However, he doesn't
	have spell slots for his spells.

* Spells
	Wart doesn't technically use "spells" unless they actually are spells. It
	makes explaining them easier if we say spells though. Wart believes that they
	are spells and so does everyone else but actually the attacks are not spells
	and require no magic whatsoever. This is why he can do some of them
	indefinitely. Attacks like "wart" and "chant" are not "magical" in
	nature. Wart is actually isn't conjuring the disease. Wart is technically
	transferring one of his diseases to the target. Since is made up of the
	disease, he doesn't need to worry about running out of uses of this. The
	others are explained in their sections.

	IMPORTANT: Wart's attacks do *not* count as magical. This means Magical
	Resistance doesn't work. However, if an enemy has resistance to physic or
	disease attacks, that will apply.

** Wart Magic
	 These spells are charm-like spells that cause damage over time. However a few
	 do normal damage.

*** Wart
		On a failed CON save, the enemy gets a bunch of bright red sores all over
		their body. These cause 1d10 of damage per turn. Every turn the enemy must
		roll a CON save, if passed the sores go away, otherwise, they will last 1
		minute. The target must be within 60 feet for the spell to have effect. The
		damage dealt increase with Wart level.

		Any non-biological target has immunity to this attack because it feeds on
		the living cells of the target. Undead creatures such as zombies, ghouls, or
		ghasts /are/ affected by this spell.


		This attack does not require "spell slots" because it isn't a spell. It
		requires no magic from Wart whatsoever. What Wart is, subconsciously, doing
		is transferring his disease to the target. It is entirely up to the target
		whether they contract it or not.

*** Helping Warts
		The target gets a bunch of warts all over them and regain 1d6 (goes up with
		level) of HP for a 1d6 (also goes up) of turns. On a short rest, you get
		a 1d6 of 1d6s (or whatever the die are).

		At the 8th level, the spell gives the target immense power. They can use the
		HP die as an inspiration die for *anything*. The disease's abilities have
		increased such that the target's entire body has temporarily perfected.

		This attack does not require "spell slots" because it isn't a spell. It
		requires no magic from Wart whatsoever. What Wart is, subconsciously, doing
		is transferring a disease to the target. It is entirely up to the target how
		long they have it for. If you're wondering how this is possible, the answer
		is simple. Wart is a humanoid conjuring of disease, yet he isn't just 1
		disease. Inside of him are a mixture of many disease. One of those disease
		is Helping Warts.

*** Chant
		Wart starts making strange chanting noises that only a singular target can
		hear. Upon a failed WIS check, the target takes 1d12 of psychic damage and
		the target will have disadvantage next turn. The target must be within 60
		feet and does *not* have to be able to physically hear Wart's chanting (it's
		done telepathically). The damage dealt increase with Wart level.

		This is technically a cantrip.

*** Lesions
		Wart causes lesions to form on the target causing them to have one of the
		following effects. Roll a d4 to choose which one

		1. Blindness (CON save)
		2. Paralysis (CON save)
		3. Headache/Confusion (WIS save) (1d4 of damage per failed save)
		4. Illusions (INT save)[fn:1]

		All of those will last 1 minute, or until the target passes the saving
		throw. They roll at the start of their turn.

		[fn:1] Which illusion the target has is chosen by rolling a d6:
		- 1-2: The target see that their skin is melting away.
		- 3-4: The target sees double of each item around he/she (5 enemies would
      become 10).
		- 5-6: Their worst nightmare appears at a distance.

		This attack does not require "spell slots" because it isn't a spell. It
		requires no magic from Wart whatsoever. What Wart is, subconsciously, doing
		is transferring his disease to the target. It is entirely up to the target
		whether they contract it or not.

*** Plague
		Wart unleashes a plague on a target. If the target fails a CON save, they
		are affected. The plague will cause the enemy to become very ill, dealing
		3d12 of biological damage. The plagues lasts until the target rolls a
		successful CON save or for a 1 minute. The plague can also causes the target
		to have disadvantage on attack rolls and AC checks due to the frailness that
		they have whilst being affect.

		The plague is so deadly that any living biological creature within 5ft of
		the target must roll a CON save or also get the plague.

		The damage caused by this increase with level.

		This attack /is/ a spell. Wart does not have enough of this disease inside
		of him to be able to command it as he needs. This means he must conjure the
		disease on the target. This requires a spell slot. This means that any
		anti-magic the target could have, /would/ apply.

*** Biological Control
		Wart can use his disease to control a target. The target must pass a WIS
		save or become victim to this. The spell lasts until the enemy rolls a
		successful WIS save or until Wart loses concentration.

		While controlled, the target can do whatever Wart wants. This does not
		include causing damage to itself; however, it can attack others.

		This attack /is/ a spell. Wart does not have enough of this disease inside
		of him to be able to command it as he needs. This means he must conjure the
		disease on the target. This requires a spell slot. This means that any
		anti-magic the target could have, /would/ apply.

*** Incurable Disease
		Wart can cause a target to be infected with a disease that isn't curable.
		This means the target will /always/ have the disease unless they get
		medicine for it. The target must succeed a CON save or fall victim to this
		disease.

		The disease will deal 5d12 of biological damage per turn. Unlike the plague,
		this disease cannot be spread.

		The damage caused by this increases with level. If you are affected by this
		spell, you are screwed. There really isn't any returning from this.

		This attack /is/ a spell. Wart does not have enough of this disease inside
		of him to be able to command it as he needs. This means he must conjure the
		disease on the target. This requires a spell slot. This means that any
		anti-magic the target could have, /would/ apply.

* Feats
** Eternally Cursed
	 Since Wart is cursed until the end of time, he cannot be cursed by any other
	 being. This means he can hold cursed items without having their effects.

	 However, because of Wart's curse he cannot gain physical strength in anyway.
	 This means he cannot increase his ability scores for STR or CON. DEX cannot
	 be increase more than 20. However, INT and WIS can go past 20.

** Sorcerous Origins
	 Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your
	 innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both
	 detailed at the end of the c1ass description.  Your choice grants
	 you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th,
	 14th, and 18th level.

	 Wart's Origins are no longer relevant; however, he's cursed origin is. That
	 being said, his origin is called Disease Magic. However, he can learn any
	 sorcerer spell if he has the time to learn it. I doubt that he will ever do
	 this and if he does, probably for a cantrip.

** Immunity
	 This feat gives Wart immunity to certain things. He gains more immunities
	 as he levels up. At the 3rd level, Wart becomes immune to any form of
	 poison. At the 10th level, Wart gains immunity to any illness (sickness from
	 food, or any germ-caused sickness). At the 17th level, Wart is immune to any
	 form of status change (whether it be slowness from an ice spell or paralysis
	 from a Ghoul).

** Pure Hideousness
	 Wart has master the art of using his scariness as an intimidation tactic. In
	 fact, he gains proficiency in intimidation and gains a +5 bonus on first
	 sight and a +3 bonus normally.

	 When a target falls to his intimidation, they have disadvantage on all saving
	 throws until they are cured of the fear. This includes AC checks.

	 Explanation of first site: Since Wart is a conjuring of disease, he is
	 extremely terrifying at first. This means he has advantage on intimidation on
	 the first site by a creature.

* Backstory
	Wart was originally a highly trained sorcerer at the Academy of Magic. He
	specialized in Wild Magic. Wart's original name was Seebo of the Ningel clan.
	He became a very powerful sorcerer at the academy and began teaching the
	young. However, one day he needed to go on a mission because there was a
	group savages that was taking over a local monastery. Seebo and a group of
	other magic users went to take care of them. However, they found themselves
	screwed when the savages out numbered them greatly. Instead of simply killing
	them, they decided to brainwash them into believing that the academy was evil.
	They did this because they believed that they could destroy the academy for
	them.

	They went back to academy and attempted to destroy the entire place and
	everyone in it. This was a complete failure and then ended up in the prison
	at the academy. Seebo attempted to escape multiple times and eventually was
	sentenced to death because of his attempted escapes (he also killed many
	people trying to escape). However, the head of the academy chose to curse him
	instead of killing him. The head hoped that after many years of being an
	ugly freak, he would come back to be taught again. At this point, Seedo became
	Wart. His body was morphed from his Gnomish self into a strange unknown
	creature that had green skin and warts all over. He was cursed to be named
	Wart as well. Wart was then banished from the academy, only to return when he
	was at peace with himself.

	Wart left and lived a miserable life for many years. He couldn't live a normal
	life any longer and was forced to live in exhale for years. One day Wart
	decided he was going to rid himself of this curse by going to the Devil's
	Circle and pleading for a cure. Upon entering the Devil's Circle he was
	granted a "cure" only if he could wipe out all non-believers in Lucive, the
	ruler of the Underworld. Wart explained that he was unable to do such a task,
	he isn't strong enough. In response to this, Lucive cursed Wart for all of
	eternity because of his lack of faith. He explained to Wart that he is now
	eternally cursed and will never be cured (this is where Wart's new abilities
	came from).

	Wart left the Devil's Circle to live his miserable life and on the
	way back to his house, he decided that he was going to do what Lucive said to
	him. Maybe if he did, he would save him. Wart went from church to church,
	town to town, city to city; planning out how he was going to wipe out the
	non-believers of Lucive. After Wart wiped out a couple of churches he became
	a Most Wanted person.

	Wart was planning on taking out a church in a town that was known for it's
	extremely rich owner (the mansion place). When Wart went in to kill the people
	he was attacked by gargoyles and placed into the jail found in the basement
	of the church. He was unable to escape because of his extremely weaken
	strength (due to the curse).

	When the church officials told the King that they caught Wart, the King's
	officials were set to get him and bring him to the Castle. However, little
	did the church know that a group of con artists faked the capturing of Wart
	and tricked the King in believing that their fake Wart was the real one.
	Because of this, Wart was left in the jail for 7 years. He trained his mind
	for 7 years and became very wise. The reason the church didn't kill him was
	because the church officials prayed about it and their god said that Wart
	was doomed anyways and the church will get their money for him one day.
	The reason the church gave away Wart to the travelers (the players) was
	because they had lost hope in it.

	This is Wart's story. His goal in life is to become uncursed and live a normal
	life. However, the players don't seem to mind his hideous face or he extremely
	dangerous abilities. He likes them. He feels at home.
