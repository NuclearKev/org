* No Mi Feats
** Compound eyes
   His eyes are compounded. This gives him dark vision up to 60ft and he cannot
   be blinded. However, his eyesight isn't very good and can't see things very
   far away.

** Insect Smell
   He is able to smell things some very very very far away. In fact, he can
   smell things up to ~4 miles away!

** Taste Touch
   He is able to "taste" things with his touch. Although this sounds gross, it
   is slightly different from tasting with the mouth. This ability allows him to
   detect if a substrate is eatable or not without the risk of poisoning. It can
   also be used to see if someone has been in a certain area before, even if it
   has been hours since them being there.

** Magically Sterile
   Due to the curse of the No Mi, he is unable to perform *anything*
   magical. This includes scrolls, wands, runes, etc. However, if he gets an
   item that has been cursed to him by the No Mi Item Curse, he can use that
   item as it he wasn't cursed. If the item that is cursed can be used as spell
   casting focus, he can then cast spells with it.

** Swim Cancellation
   For some unknown reason, No Mi make the user very sensitive to being
   submerged in water. They will lose all ability to move and will most likely
   drown.

      bite, but are very reliable. Kysu likes them due to their loyalty towards
      him and their constructive abilities with a pollen-infused mud. Kysu can
      use them as a weapon in battle, and they will act like a conjured
      monster. See [[Swarm of Wasps][Swarm of Wasps]]

* Backstory
  Kysu was born in the city of Lum'is by a bard of the Lum'is army (father) and an
  intellectual of the order (mother). His early childhood was spent learning the
  art of music from his father. Although he didn't learn much, he was able to
  perform basic (level 1) bardic spells such as bardic inspiration. Around the
  age of 9, his father was sent to war and he was left in the hand (she only had
  1 arm) of his mother. She enrolled him into the educational program for the
  Lum'is kingdom, where he studied to become a mathematician. Kysu was at the
  top of his class and was looked up to by many of his peers.

  When Kysu was 11, the Lum'is army had found a magical fruit called a No Mi. In
  order to teach all the people of Lum'is, the kind decided to show everyone the
  fruit and told them all to never ever get involved with them. They are
  extremely illegal and you will be killed just for having one. If you eat one,
  you will become extremely dangerous and most likely killed immediately without
  trial.

  While the kids in the educational program were being shown this fruit, Kysu
  couldn't help but have an extreme attachment towards the fruit. Just looking
  at it made him salivate. For whatever reason, he *had* to eat it. Later that
  night, he sneaked into the king's hidden chamber and ate the fruit. He fell to
  the ground in agony. It felt like his insides were on fire! The pain was so
  great that he passed out.

  He awoke a few hours later in a daze. He sat up and looked around, confused
  where he was. After a few minutes, he realized he was still in the king's
  hidden chamber and needed to leave immediately. However, something was
  bothering him. His vision seemed to have changed... The world seemed -
  different. He also began to smell something. It smelled delicious! He realized
  that this smell was coming from the king's private kitchen, which was very far
  away and there was no way that he could be smelling it from where he was. He
  shook it off and began to get up. Right has he placed his hands on the floor
  to assist in getting off the floor, he has a strange sensation in his hands! A
  new sense? It also was like he could /taste/ the floor! Very disturbed from
  this he got up and began to head for the door. Right as he got to the door he
  smelt the scent of someone coming. In a panic he attempted to hide. However,
  it was no use and the guard found him.

  He was brought directly to the king. The king said angrily: "What is your
  name, child?" To which Kysu replied nervously: "Kysu, your majesty." The
  king's booming voice instilling fear into Kysu said: "Kysu! The boy which whom
  betrayed the Lum'is Kingdom! Where you not told to not touch the fruit?" "Yes,
  your majesty, I was told" "Then why did you do such an act?!" "I do not know,
  your majesty. The fruit was calling my name!" "Calling your name? I've never
  heard of a fruit /calling/ someones name! Child, what you have done is
  punishable by death, however, I will let you go on one condition." "What is
  that, your majesty?" "You shall be banished to the swamps of Lum'is for the
  rest of your days. For if you return to Lum'is, you will be tried and hanged
  from the gallows!" Kysu noticed something at that very moment. He said
  /tried/. That means he /could/ win and not be killed! "Your majesty, what if I
  win the trial?" "Hahaha! If you win the trial, you will be free to live in
  Lum'is. But I don't foresee that happening..." "You underestimate me, your
  majesty." "I assume that is a challenge? How dare you challenge the king!" "It
  is a challenge, my lord, and I will win!" "Guards, take this scum to his new
  home!" As the guards were dragging him out, the king said: "I have a feeling
  we will meet again, Kysu. I accept your challenge."

  From that day on, Kysu remained a hermit in the swamps of Lum'is. During this
  time, he began to master his abilities. He was able to speak with insects and
  as a direct result, created a small town called Entrup, meaning "A safe city
  for bugs" in insect (converted to common). This town was full of all kinds of
  bugs; ants, bees, and beetles lived here without worry. He also became friends
  will all of the insects throughout the swamp. He used his ability to learn
  about all types of insects. In fact, he was able to use the insects to spy on
  Lum'is. He used insects to checkup on his mother and the rest of the town.

  Many years pasted and Kysu had remained in the same place doing the same
  thing. Until one day, a Giant Acid-Spitting Fly returned from Lum'is with some
  shocking news about a strange person doing business in the castle with one of
  the chiefs. Intrigued, Kysu ordered all insects to be on the watch for
  this. During this time, Kysu also began using his insects to eradicate crime
  in Lum'is. Most notably, the use of a giant moth species called Mothmen. The
  citizens of Lum'is were both afraid of the Mothman (they believed there was
  only one) and grateful. The mothmen were able to protect the people of the
  town from the villains that were secretly getting in.

  We meet Kysu at the age of 22 while in the heat of his search for answers! He
  was informed that there was an odd group of outsiders that had entered the
  city and talked with the king. In fact, they were in search of /runes/! That
  means they would most likely be coming to see Charcoln! Kysu awaits for them.
